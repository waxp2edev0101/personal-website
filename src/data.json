                    "snippet": "Netflix’s first-quarter earnings did not hit analyst estimates for revenue and surpassed them for earnings per share. The streaming giant also gave a new timeline to curb password sharing.\n\nNetflix said its first-quarter revenue increased 3.7% to $8.16 billion. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $2.88 for the quarter, down from the same three-month span last year.\n\nRefinitiv analysts had anticipated $8.18 billion for revenue, and 2023’s Q1 narrowly missed that. On diluted earnings per share, Netflix beat estimates by about $0.02.\n\nNetflix’s quarterly profits narrowed from the same time last year, with the streaming giant posting $1.3 billion in net income compared to $1.6 billion in the first-quarter of 2022.\n\nNETFLIX TO SHIP LAST RED ENVELOPE LATER THIS YEAR\n\nThe company reported a continuation of the recent trend of subscriber growth. In the first quarter, it gained 1.75 million subscribers, a lift that brought the service’s total paid membership to 232.5 million. The Asia Pacific region led in additions with 1.46 million, and all but the Latin American region saw net increases.\n\nNetflix, in an update to its plans, also revealed the U.S. and other countries can expect to see the broader launch of the company’s new password-sharing restrictions in the second quarter.\n\nThat wider move will come after Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain already saw their Netflix users become subject to a new paid sharing policy in February.\n\nUnder the new policy, a subscriber with a standard or premium account can add an \"extra member\" at an extra cost. The four countries' success with the policy \"pleased\" Netflix, the company said.\n\nNETFLIX'S AD-SUPPORTED PLAN GETS LAUNCH DATE, PRICE\n\n\"With each launch, we learn more about how best to roll out these changes and what matters to members the most, in particular maintaining travel/watching on the go and the ability for people to better control access to their accounts as well as transfer profiles to separate accounts,\" Netflix said. \"We could have launched broadly in late Q1, but we found enough improvement opportunities in these areas to shift a broad launch to Q2 to implement those changes.\"\n\nNetflix said that while it did observe an initial \"cancel reaction\" in the four markets upon the news of the change, it later saw \"increased acquisition and revenue\" as account borrowers shifted to their own accounts or became \"extra members\" on an existing one. The wider launch will \"shift some of the membership growth and revenue benefit from Q2 to Q3\" but will \"ensure a bigger revenue base\" long term, according to the company.\n\nNETFLIX PASSWORD-SHARING CRACKDOWN DETAILS RELEASED\n\nThe streaming giant pointed to Canada as a \"predictor\" for how the U.S. market will react to paid sharing. There, the subscriber base became \"larger than prior to the launch of paid sharing,\" according to Netflix.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % NFLX NETFLIX INC. 333.70 +0.98 +0.29%\n\nNetflix also disclosed that a total of 116 countries saw the cost of subscriptions decline during the quarter, a share it said \"represented less than 5%\" of its 2022 revenue. The company said it \"believe[s] that increasing adoption in these markets will help to maximize our revenue longer term.\"\n\nFor the second quarter, the streaming giant projected $8.24 billion in revenue and $1.28 billion in net income.",

                    "snippet": "Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) late Tuesday missed Wall Street's target for new subscribers in the first quarter and offered a weak outlook. Netflix stock initially plummeted on the news but later rebounded in extended trading.\n\nX\n\nThe Los Gatos, Calif.-based company added 1.75 million streaming video subscribers in the March quarter vs. forecasts for 2.2 million. It ended the first quarter with 232.5 million total subscribers worldwide.\n\nMost of Netflix's subscriber growth was in the Asia Pacific region, where it added 1.46 million net new subscribers. In the U.S. and Canada, Netflix added just 100,000 subscribers. Meanwhile, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Netflix gained 640,000 subscribers.\n\nHowever, Netflix lost 450,000 subscribers in Latin America in the first quarter.\n\nNetflix Misses With Sales, Earnings Outlook\n\nNetflix earned $2.88 a share on sales of $8.16 billion in the March quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Netflix to earn $2.86 a share on sales of $8.18 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Netflix earnings fell 18% while sales climbed 4%.\n\nFor the current quarter, Netflix predicts earnings of $2.84 a share on sales of $8.24 billion. But Wall Street was projecting earnings of $3.07 a share on sales of $8.47 billion for the second quarter. In the year-earlier period, Netflix earned $3.20 a share on sales of $7.97 billion.\n\nDuring after-hours trading on the stock market today, Netflix stock initially fell but later recovered. In recent trades, it was up 0.6% to 335.82. During the regular session Tuesday, Netflix stock rose 0.3% to 333.70.\n\nPopular shows for Netflix in the first quarter included new series \"The Night Agent,\" \"That 90s Show\" and \"The Glory.\" The quarter also brought new seasons of \"Outer Banks\" and \"Ginny & Georgia\" as well as movie sequel \"Murder Mystery 2.\"\n\nIn other news, Netflix announced Tuesday that it is ending its U.S.-only, DVD-by-mail rental service after 25 years of operation. It will ship out its final discs to subscribers on Sept. 29.\n\nNetflix Stock Is Tops In Industry Group\n\nNetflix stock has formed a cup-with-handle base with a buy point at 349.90, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix stock ranks first out of 21 stocks in IBD's Leisure-Movies & Related industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 86 out of 99.\n\nCatalysts for Netflix stock recently have included the addition of an advertising-supported service level and efforts to monetize account sharing.\n\nFollow Patrick Seitz on Twitter at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nBroadcom Claims Its New Chip Speeds Networking For Artificial Intelligence\n\nAdobe Takes Generative AI To Next Level\n\nApple Bets On Growth In India With Retail, Manufacturing Expansion\n\nSee Stocks On The List Of Leaders Near A Buy Point\n\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSmith Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens",

                    "snippet": "Netflix said it will stage a “broad rollout” of its paid-sharing plan in the second quarter of 2023, including in the U.S., aiming to convert freeloaders borrowing someone else’s password into revenue-generating subscribers.\n\nThe streamer announced the news in releasing its first quarter 2023 earnings report. Previously, Netflix had said it planned to commence a broader launch of the paid password-sharing program in Q1. As part of Netflix’s crackdown on customers sharing passwords with people outside their household, the company plans to start blocking devices (after a certain period of time) that attempt to access a Netflix account without properly paying.\n\n“In Q1, we launched paid sharing in four countries and are pleased with the results,” Netflix said in its Q1 letter to shareholders. “We are planning on a broad rollout, including in the U.S., in Q2.”\n\nThe paid-sharing program will debut in Q2 in the “vast majority” of countries where Netflix offers service, co-CEO Greg Peters said on the earnings interview, with pricing varying by market.\n\nThe four markets it is referring to are Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain, where in February Netflix launched a “buy an extra member” option that lets primary account holders pay an additional monthly fee for a sub-account for 1-2 people they don’t live with. That came after Netflix last year launched paid-sharing tests in three Latin American countries (Chile, Costa Rica and Peru). Netflix’s paid membership count does not include “extra members”; rather, the total revenue from a primary account and its sub-accounts result in higher average revenue per membership.\n\nNetflix said the move to convert password-piggybackers into paying members produces an elevated volume of cancelations, leading to a hit on near-term subscriber growth. “This will not be a universally popular move,” Peters said on the Q4 2022 earnings interview in January, likening it to an uptick in churn when the company has raised prices on its streaming plans.\n\nStarting with the last quarter of 2022, Netflix was no longer providing subscriber-growth estimates for the following quarter. However, it said it projects Q2 paid net adds “roughly similar to” to the first quarter, when it gained 1.75 million. The company does provide financial guidance but said the rollout of its paid-sharing initiative and ad-supported plans “leads to less-than-normal visibility.”\n\n“As with Latin America, we see a cancel reaction in each market when we announce [paid sharing plans], which impacts near-term member growth,” the company said in the Q1 shareholder letter. “But as borrowers start to activate their own accounts and existing members add ‘extra member’ accounts, we\n\nsee increased acquisition and revenue.”\n\nIn Canada, which Netflix believes is a “reliable predictor” for behavior in the U.S., its paid membership base is now larger than prior to the launch of paid sharing, while revenue growth has accelerated and is now growing faster than in the U.S.\n\n“With each launch, we learn more about how best to roll out these changes and what matters to members the most, in particular maintaining travel/watching on the go and the ability for people to better control access to their accounts as well as transfer profiles to separate accounts,” Netflix said. Instead of launching the paid-sharing plans broadly in late Q1, Netflix said, it “found enough improvement opportunities in these areas to shift a broad launch to Q2 to implement those changes. As noted above, while this will shift some of the membership growth and revenue benefit from Q2 to Q3, we believe it will result in a better outcome for our members and our business. Longer term, paid sharing will ensure a bigger revenue base from which we can grow as we improve our service.”\n\nNetflix estimates that passwords are being shared in violation of its rules with more than 100 million non-paying households worldwide. It first cited that figure a year ago, when the company told investors it was focusing on generating revenue from password-sharing users.\n\n“A Netflix account is meant to be shared in one household (people who live in the same location with the account owner),” the company says on the customer-help section of its site. “People who are not in your household will need to sign up for their own account to watch Netflix.” However, Netflix members can continue to access the service while traveling via their personal devices or by logging in to new TV (like at a hotel or vacation rental).",

                    "snippet": "By Dawn Chmielewski and Lisa Richwine\n\n(Reuters) - Netflix Inc beat Wall Street earnings estimates for the first quarter but offered a lighter-than-expected forecast on Tuesday, demonstrating the challenges the mature streaming service faces in its pursuit of growth.\n\nThe company said it shifted a wider launch of a plan to crack down on unsanctioned password sharing into the second quarter to make improvements, delaying some financial benefits, but said it was pleased with results so far.\n\nAs the streaming video pioneer faces signs of market saturation, it is looking to new ways to make money, such as the password crackdown and a new ad-supported service.\n\nRevenue and earnings for the first quarter came in roughly in line with the average analyst estimates from Refinitiv. Earnings per share hit $2.88 with revenue of $8.162 billion.\n\n\"We are growing and we are profitable,\" Co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos said in the company's post-earnings video interview. \"We have a clear path to accelerate growth in both revenue and profit, and we're executing it.\"\n\nShares of Netflix dropped as much as 11% in after-hours trade following the report but recovered to gain 1.4%.\n\nNetflix serves as a bellwether for the streaming industry, in which growth has slowed as competition has intensified.\n\nFrom January through March, Netflix added 1.75 million streaming subscribers, missing analyst estimates of 2.06 million additions.\n\nAnalyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight described the first- quarter results as mixed.\n\n\"Netflix is a mature business reinforcing less reliance on subscriber growth. However, this metric still moves the needle for key stakeholders,\" he said.\n\nGRAPHIC-Netflix earnings https://www.reuters.com/graphics/EARNINGS-AUTOMATED/NFLX-OQ/gdpzqnlgavw/chart.png\n\nThe company began rolling out its solution for password-sharing - offering a \"paid sharing\" option - in 12 countries in February but is delaying expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We believe it will result in a better outcome for our members and our business,\" the company said. Netflix also said it was \"on track to meet our full year 2023 financial objectives.\"\n\nThe clampdown on password sharing will begin in the United States during the current quarter, Netflix said.\n\nFor April through June, the company forecast $8.242 billion in revenue and $2.86 in diluted EPS. Wall Street had been projecting $8.476 billion for revenue and $3.05 for diluted EPS.\n\nNetflix also is moving into live streaming. The company angered fans of dating show \"Love is Blind\" on Sunday when a reunion special that was meant to be shown live was unavailable. The mishap was due to a \"bug\" that has been fixed, Co-CEO Greg Peters said on Tuesday.\n\nA year ago, Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers - its first subscriber decline in more than a decade, sending its stock reeling and resetting Wall Street's expectations for the sector.\n\nNetflix added nearly 9 million subscribers in 2022, half as many as the 18 million gained in the prior year, with much of that growth coming from Asia, notes research firm MoffettNathanson. The gains it made in Asia and Latin America have impacted the average revenue per user, spurring Netflix to make changes to its business model, the firm said.\n\nThe company introduced a lower-priced version of its service with ads in 12 countries in the fourth quarter.\n\nUBS media analyst John Hodulik wrote that the password- sharing crackdown could well fuel Netflix's nascent advertising business, as it drives these \"sharers\" to the lower-priced version of the service.\n\nSarandos said Netflix hopes Hollywood studios can reach a \"fair and equitable\" deal with writers to avoid a strike, but he also noted the company has access to programming from around the world that it can offer if U.S.-based production is disrupted.\n\n(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski and Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Henderson, Matthew Lewis and Lincoln Feast)",

                    "snippet": "Netflix is planning a \"broad rollout\" of the password sharing crackdown that it began implementing in 2022, the company said today in its Q1 2023 earnings report [PDF].\n\n\n\nThe \"paid sharing\" plan that Netflix has been testing in a limited number of countries will expand to additional countries in the second quarter, including the United States. Netflix said that it was \"pleased with the results\" of the password sharing restrictions that it implemented in Canada, New Zealand, Spain, and Portugal earlier this year.\n\nNetflix initially planned to start eliminating password sharing in the United States in the first quarter of the year, but the company said that it had learned from its tests and \"found opportunities to improve the experience for members.\" There is a \"cancel reaction\" expected in each market where paid sharing is implemented, but increased revenue comes later as borrowers activate their own Netflix accounts and existing members add \"extra member\" accounts.\n\nIn Canada, paid sharing resulted in a larger Netflix membership base and an acceleration in revenue growth, which has given Netflix the confidence to expand it to the United States.\n\nWhen Netflix brings its paid sharing rules to the United States, multi-household account use will no longer be permitted. Netflix subscribers who share an account with those who do not live with them will need to pay for an additional member. In Canada, Netflix charges $7.99 CAD for an extra member, which is around $6.\n\nPrices are per person, and up to two additional people can be added to an existing Netflix Standard or Premium plan. The extra price provides each person with a profile, personalized recommendations, login, and password. Alternatively, people who share a Netflix account with someone outside of their household at the current time can initiate a profile transfer process that will allow the person who has free access to the account to make their own separate, paid account.\n\nNetflix users will need to establish a primary location, and subscribers who are not at this location will not be able to use the service through that account. There are allowances for travel or second homes, with Netflix requiring users to open the Netflix app at the primary location once per month.\n\nNetflix claims that more than 100 million households are sharing accounts, which is impacting its ability to \"invest in and improve Netflix\" for paying members.",

                    "snippet": "Netflix on Tuesday posted mixed financial results and said it was pushing back its broad rollout of its password-sharing crackdown.\n\nOriginally, Netflix wanted the rollout to take place late in the first quarter, but on Tuesday it said it would do it in the second quarter.\n\n\"While this means that some of the expected membership growth and revenue benefit will fall in Q3 rather than Q2, we believe this will result in a better outcome from both our members and our business,\" the company said in its earnings release.\n\nThe company said it saw its subscriber growth impacted in the international markets where it has already rolled out such initiatives.\n\nHere are the results Netflix reported Tuesday versus estimates from analysts polled by Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: $2.88 vs $2.86 expected\n\n$2.88 vs $2.86 expected Revenue: $8.16 billion vs $8.18 billion expected\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, Netflix reported earnings of $1.31 billion, or $2.88 a share, compared with $1.6 billion, or $3.53 a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew to $8.16 billion from $7.87 billion in the prior-year period.\n\nShares of Netflix initially fell more than 10% but mostly recovered in after hours trading.\n\nNetflix's crackdown on password sharing has been top of mind for investors. Late last year, the company said it would begin rolling out measures to have people who have been borrowing other accounts create their own.\n\nThe company has said more than 100 million households share accounts, or about 43% of its global user base. That has affected its ability to invest in new content, Netflix has said. Both the ad-supported option and crackdown on password sharing are meant to boost profits.\n\n\"The launch in Q2 will be broad, including the U.S. and the bulk of our countries when we think about it from a revenue perspective,\" said co-CEO Greg Peters on Tuesday's earnings call. Peters likened the paid sharing transition to that of increasing prices – subscribers initially balk and cancel, then slowly return and sign up for their own accounts.\n\nIn February, Netflix outlined password-sharing guidance in four countries: New Zealand, Canada, Portugal and Spain. The company said it would ask users in those countries to set a \"primary location\" for their accounts, and allow users to establish up to two \"sub accounts\" for those who don't live in their home base for extra fees.\n\nNetflix said Tuesday it has been pleased with its push to mitigate password sharing. In Latin America, the company said it saw cancellations after the news was announced, which affected near-term growth. But, Netflix added, those password borrowers would later activate their own accounts ad add existing members as \"extra member\" accounts. As a result, the company said, it is seeing more revenue.\n\nCanada, which will likely serve as a template for the U.S., has seen its membership base grow due to the launch of paid sharing, and revenue growth has accelerated and \"is growing faster than in the U.S.\"\n\nThe company said that as it rolls out its paid sharing initiatives, it expects near term engagement – which is measured by Nielsen for its ad-supported tier – to \"likely shrink modestly.\" Still, the company believes it will bounce back as its seen in international regions.",

                    "snippet": "Netflix said a crackdown on password-sharing among U.S. subscribers is coming sometime between April and June — modestly delaying a plan that has caused consternation among many subscribers of the streaming service.\n\nIn its quarterly earnings report, Netflix said it was \"pleased with the results\" of a paid password-sharing system it launched in four countries and would introduce it to the U.S. in the second quarter. The company had earlier said it planned to introduce it by the end of March.\n\nBacklash expected\n\nNews that Netflix would no longer allow users to share their passwords broadly has roiled its fan base. The strategy shows a 180-degree shift for the streaming company, which once encouraged password sharing as a way to attract more viewers.\n\nNow, as it faces competition for streaming viewers from Disney+, Hulu, Peacock and Paramount+, Netflix is looking to make more money from its existing subscribers.\n\nThe company expects some backlash once it requires sharers to pay up.\n\n\"This will not be a universally popular move, so there will be current members that are unhappy,\" co-CEO Greg Peters previously told investors.\n\nThat's what has happened every time Netflix has rolled out \"paid sharing\" in a country, the company said, citing a \"cancel reaction\" to the program in Canada, New Zealand, Spain and Portugal, when Netflix first started requiring password-sharers to pay more.\n\n\"As a reminder, as we roll out paid sharing — and as some borrowers stop watching either because they don't convert to extra members or full paying accounts — near term engagement, as measured by third parties like Nielsen, will likely shrink modestly,\" the company wrote.\n\nOver time, however, it believes this strategy will grow its membership.\n\nNetflix estimates 100 households worldwide share passwords with other people.\n\nThe company clearly \"wants to manage any fallout from the new [password sharing] strategy,\" Jamie Lumley, analyst at Third Bridge, said in a note. \"Whether the launch gets further delayed is a big question as we head into the next few months.\"",

                    "snippet": "Netflix Inc.’s stock initially plunged in after-hours trading Tuesday, after the streaming giant posted weaker subscriber growth and forecast a smaller profit than Wall Street expected. But shares later erased most of their losses on company disclosures that its new ad-supported service is a success and its crackdown on shared accounts in the U.S. is coming this quarter.\n\nNetflix NFLX, +0.29% reported that subscribers increased by 1.75 million in the first quarter of the year, missing analysts’ average estimate of 2.2 million. Netflix reported fiscal first-quarter net earnings of $1.31 billion, or $2.88 a share, compared with $3.53 a share in the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenue improved to $8.16 billion from $7.87 billion a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected on average net earnings of $2.86 a share on revenue of $8.18 billion.\n\nFor the second quarter, Netflix executives guided for earnings of $2.84 a share on $8.24 billion in revenue, while analysts on average were expecting earnings of $3.07 a share on sales of $8.18 billion. Netflix no longer provides guidance on subscriber additions, a sign its years of rapid growth are clearly cooling.\n\nAlso see: As the original Netflix dies, a new era of ads and password crackdowns is born\n\nShares plunged 10% lower, below $300, in after-hours trading immediately following the release of the results, after closing the regular session with a 0.3% increase at $333.70. After briefly crossing into positive territory, shares ended the extended session down just 0.2%.\n\nIn their first video earnings call without company co-founder and former CEO Reed Hastings, Netflix’s executive team called the first quarter “business as usual” as they transition from hyper subscriber growth to greater profitability.\n\nNetflix executives have hoped to goose their financial results with cheaper, ad-supported options and a crackdown on password sharing. In a letter to shareholders Tuesday, company executives said the ads plan in the U.S. “already has a total ARM (subscription + ads) greater than our standard plan.”\n\nAt the same time, they disclosed a password crackdown in the U.S. will occur in the second quarter, a bit later from previous expectations.\n\n“We shifted out the timing of the broad launch from late Q1 to Q2,” Netflix executives wrote. “While this means that some of the expected membership growth and revenue benefit will fall in Q3 rather than Q2, we believe this will result in a\n\nbetter outcome for both our members and our business.”\n\nAdditionally, Netflix also announced that it will end the DVD-by-mail business that launched the company into consumers’ homes. Revenue from the DVD business had declined from $911 million in 2013 to $146 million in 2022.\n\n“This a catch-22 environment for streaming companies as they are pivoting from chasing subscribers to chasing profits while at the same time inflation-weary consumers are reassessing their discretionary spending habits,” KPMG U.S. National Media Leader Scott Purdy said, in assessing the results. “Today’s figures, a bellwether for the industry at large, signal that winter is coming for the consumer. All of the subsidies are ending. Consumers can expect to be hit with ads, higher prices, and password sharing crackdown.”\n\nExpectations among investors heading into Netflix’s quarterly report were muted. The focus was on Netflix’s switch toward better monetization with an ad-supported service and a rolling crackdown on shared accounts. Analysts in particular were closely watching the performance of Netflix’s new “Basic with Ads” plan ($6.99 a month) and its effectiveness in stanching the defection of subscribers to competing services from Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.63% and Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.75% .\n\nNetflix’s rollout of the ad-supported tier could also have a temporary impact on margins: Netflix reported an operating margin of 21%, compared with about 25% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAt the same time, Netflix put an end to paid shared accounts in some Latin American countries last year, and expanded plans to do so Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain in February.\n\n“In our view, the password-sharing crackdown will result in a greater number of subs as well as revenue because the primary account holder will either pay an additional fee for members who have moved out of the household or those sharing accounts become full subscribers,” Bank of America analysts said in a recent note.",

                    "snippet": "Netflix added 1.75 million net new subscribers in Q1, compared with gaining a whopping 7.66 million for the final quarter of 2022, the period during which its lower-cost, ad-supported tier launched, the streamer revealed in its first-quarter 2023 earnings results Tuesday.\n\nRunning from Jan. 1-March 31, Q1 marked the first full quarter with Netflix’s ad-filled option available to subscribers. The streamer ended the period with a total global subscriber count of 232.5 million.\n\nNetflix halted its pattern of providing subscriber guidance for the next quarter with its Q4 earnings in January, citing a shift in focus away from subs growth and toward revenue. As such, no self-set goals were revealed by the streamer for Wall Street to compare these Q1 results to — but a general consensus saw investors banking on approximately 2.3 million net additions.\n\nWhile the 1.75 million growth in new customers is far from 2.3 million, it does still represent 4.9% year-over-year growth in subscribers for Netflix.\n\nPaid memberships rose 100,000 in the U.S. and Canada, 640,000 throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 1.5 million in the Asia-Pacific region. Subs fell by 450,000 in Latin America.\n\n“In Q1, we had several big returning series and films – demonstrating our growing ability to develop stories across genres – including ‘Outer Banks’ S3, ‘You’ S4, ‘Ginny & Georgia’ S2, ‘Soy Georgina’ S2, ‘The Glory’s’ new installment and a big sequel to our hit film ‘Murder Mystery,”” Netflix said in a letter to shareholders accompanying the Q1 financials. “Building anticipation and buzz before and after titles premiere is a key goal for our marketing team as it helps drive acquisition and retention.”\n\nElsewhere in the note to investors, Netflix revealed that beginning in Q2, it will finally expand its password-sharing crackdown to the U.S. The company plans to start blocking devices (after a certain period of time) that attempt to access a Netflix account without properly paying. “In Q1, we launched paid sharing in four countries and are pleased with the results,” Netflix said. “We are planning on a broad rollout, including in the U.S., in Q2.”\n\nWall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $2.86 on $8.2 billion in revenue, according to analyst consensus data provided by Refinitiv. Netflix actually reported diluted EPS of $2.88 (or $1.3 billion net income) on $8.2 billion in revenue, beating on earnings and meeting revenue expectations. Revenue was up 3.7% year over year.\n\nFree cash flow stood at $2.1 billion. Operating income was $1.7 billion with a 21% operating margin.\n\nRevenue from U.S. and Canada ops grew 8% vs. Q1 2022, while Europe, Middle East and Africa revenue was down 2%. Latin America revenue was up 7% and Asia-Pacific increased 2%.\n\n“We’re on track to meet our full year 2023 financial objectives,” Netflix wrote. “For Q2’23, we forecast revenue of $8.2B, up 3% year over year, or 6% growth on an F/X neutral basis. We’re pleased with the most recent launches of paid sharing, and while we could have launched broadly in Q1, we found opportunities to improve the experience for members. We learn more with each rollout and we’ve incorporated the latest learnings, which we think will lead to even better results. To implement these changes, we shifted out the timing of the broad launch from late Q1 to Q2. While this means that some of the expected membership growth and revenue benefit will fall in Q3 rather than Q2, we believe this will result in a better outcome for both our members and our business.”\n\nNetflix stock closed Tuesday at $333.70 per share. The regular U.S. stock markets will reopen at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe streamer will release a pre-recorded interview with new Ted Sarandos and new co-CEO Greg Peters, following the shift of co-founder Reed Hastings to chairman, discussing the quarter in greater detail at 6 p.m. ET.\n\nVIP+ Analysis: What to Watch in Q1 2023 Media Earnings",

                    "snippet": "After testing account-sharing fees in Latin America last year, Netflix implemented its new policy in February in four regions, including Canada and Spain. Now, for many subscribers in the US, it's the moment they have not been waiting for. Password-sharing fees are officially rolling out in the second quarter, which would be by the end of June.\n\nThe streaming service announced the move in a letter to shareholders Tuesday but didn't say how much it will charge in the US for password sharing. Netflix subscribers who are sharing their passwords with people outside their physical households will have to pay for each subaccount. In countries where paid sharing has already rolled out, only subscribers with Standard or Premium plans can add extra members, which is capped at two per account. Otherwise, users who live outside of a paying member's household will be blocked from the platform and prompted to open their own accounts with the option to transfer their profiles.\n\nIn Canada, where account-sharing fees have rolled out, Netflix says its paid subscriber base is \"larger than prior to the launch of paid sharing\" and is growing. The company believes it will achieve similar results in the US. However, during its quarterly investors' call on Monday, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said the streamer is still considering how much to charge.\n\n\"We tested different pricing in these rollouts than what we tested in Latin America, and that gives you a sense of how we're thinking about what is optimal pricing -- especially in more affluent countries,\" Peters said.\n\nWhen Netflix outlined its plans for the password-sharing crackdown in February, the company required members to set a primary location for their accounts. Subscribers will still have the ability to watch videos on demand while traveling. Customers in Canada must pay CA$8 per month for each extra user. In Spain, the fee is 6 euros, for Portugal it's 4 euros, and in New Zealand it's NZ$8. Based on those amounts, it's expected Netflix will charge US subscribers between $7 and $8 per subaccount.\n\nThe streaming giant has drawn backlash for the policy, which comes after raising the prices for its most popular subscription tiers in 2022. Some customers threatened to cancel their accounts once the new fees rolls out, and others expressed concerns about their college kids, parents and family members in the military being kicked off their subscriptions.\n\nIn late February, Netflix slashed the prices of its subscriptions in over 100 markets, including Latin America, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Some countries, like Venezuela, saw a reduction of as much as 50%.\n\nSince experiencing a drop in subscriber numbers in the first quarter of 2022, Netflix has focused on new ways to monetize its service. In November, the company launched Basic with Ads, an ad-supported tier that costs $7 per month and offers one stream. Along with the new subscription plan, the company credits the release of TV shows like Wednesday, Outer Banks season 3 and Ginny & Georgia season 2 for helping bolster viewership and subscriber numbers for early 2023.",

                    "snippet": "Netflix’s controversial password sharing crackdown is about to come to the United States and other countries. In its quarterly earnings report today, Netflix revealed that it will expand its paid password sharing system to the United States within the next three months. Head below for the full details on what this means…\n\nNetflix’s password sharing crackdown is expanding\n\nThe new system, which is currently available in four countries, prevents users from sharing passwords with people outside of their households by requiring a device logged into a Netflix account to log into the home Wi-Fi network of that account at least once every 31 days.\n\nNetflix uses data such as IP addresses, account activity, and device IDs to “determine whether a device signed into your account” is actually associated with the account’s primary location.\n\nTo ensure uninterrupted access to Netflix, connect to the Wi-Fi at your primary location, open the Netflix app or website, and watch something at least once every 31 days. This creates a trusted device so you can watch Netflix, even when you’re away from your primary location. If you are away from your primary location for an extended period of time, your device may be blocked from watching Netflix. You can request a temporary access code to continue watching.\n\nIn the countries where this policy is currently implemented, which include Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain, Netflix allows users to pay an extra monthly fee for a “sub-account” for people they don’t live with.\n\nIn a note to shareholders, Netflix said that it has been “pleased with the results” of its measures to block users from sharing passwords so far. In Canada, for example, Netflix says that its “paid membership base is now larger than prior to the launch of paid sharing.”\n\nAs such, it is “planning on a broad rollout” to more countries, including the United States, in Q2. This means that starting sometime between now and the end of June, Netflix will implement its password sharing crackdown in the United States and a number of other countries. The full list hasn’t been announced just yet, but Netflix has confirmed that the US is included.\n\nNetflix also reiterates today that there are over 100 million households currently sharing passwords, which “undermines our ability to invest in and improve Netflix for our paying members.”\n\nAhead of the implementation of anti-password sharing features, you can visit your Netflix account settings to view devices currently logged into your account. This page also showed details on the location and IP addresses of those devices. This location information is what Netflix will use when determining the “primary location” of your account and associated devices.\n\nIs Netflix’s account sharing crackdown going to have an impact on how you use the streaming service? Let us know in the comments.",

                    "snippet": "It could mean billions of dollars wrangling in the 30 million households in the United States and Canada that aren't properly monetized.\n\nThe day has come for all you freeloaders. After months of build up and test rollouts in other countries, Netflix’s crackdown on password sharing is finally coming to the U.S. and abroad in the coming weeks.\n\n“In Q1, we launched paid sharing in four countries and are pleased with the results. We are planning on a broad rollout, including in the U.S., in Q2,” Netflix said in its first quarter earnings results for fiscal 2023.\n\nThe password sharing crackdown, which has already taken effect in Canada, New Zealand, Spain, and Portugal following a test run in Latin America, works this way: account holders have to set info about their primary location, as well as manage account access and devices, and you’ll only be able to share your password with other people in the same household. Anyone who is using that account outside of that household will have to get the account owner to add them onto their plan at the additional fee or switch to a new plan. Should you be traveling on vacation and watching Netflix on the go, you’ll be prompted to enter a verification code that only lasts temporarily for about a week.\n\nNetflix began charging $7.99/month in Canadian Dollars per person to add an extra account. If you are switching and starting your own account, Netflix also last fall launched a feature called “Profile Transfers” so that people who have been password sharing can still preserve their watching history and algorithmic data based on their viewing habits and not start from scratch.\n\nNetflix said this time last year that it estimates 100 million households are not properly monetized (it reiterated that figure in today’s earnings), or that they’re mooching off another account holder. From that, about 30 million of those users are in the U.S. and Canada, where subscriber growth has effectively plateaued for some time. This quarter, Netflix added 1.75 million subscribers globally.\n\nCracking down on password sharing could help Netflix finally break that trend domestically and get people who have avoided paying for Netflix to either sign up as new users or to be added as additional users on someone’s existing plan. For those unwilling to pay full freight, some may opt to join under the cheapest pricing tier for Netflix with ads. Last quarter when Basic With Ads launched, Netflix added 7.66 million subs globally.\n\nThe streamer also said that when the news of the program has been announced, they immediately see a “cancel reaction” in each market. But over time, Netflix says, those borrowers start to activate their own accounts and others add extra members. That was particularly true of Canada, where the streamer says the paid membership base is now higher than it was before they rolled out the paid sharing plan, and subscriber growth is going up faster there than it is in the U.S.\n\n“With each launch, we learn more about how best to roll out these changes and what matters to members the most, in particular maintaining travel/watching on the go and the ability for people to better control access to their accounts as well as transfer profiles to separate accounts,” Netflix said. “While this will shift some of the membership growth and revenue benefit from Q2 to Q3, we believe it will result in a better outcome for our members and our business. Longer term, paid sharing will ensure a bigger revenue base from which we can grow as we improve our service.”\n\nNetflix also gave a caveat that in the short term, engagement from places like Nielsen will “likely shrink modestly” as people begin to cancel, but they predict that should improve over time.\n\nWall Street analysts are more excited than you are that Netflix is finally taking password sharing seriously, and that’s because they estimate that new signups as a result of the enforcement could be worth upwards of $3 billion domestically. That’s because even if a third, or 10 million, of those users ultimately convert or get added as additional users, which several analysts say is a realistic and conservative estimate, that’s still a big chunk of change.\n\nIt could be even more lucrative internationally where analysts say that password sharing crackdowns may not be as bumpy or lead to as many people cancelling altogether than might do so stateside, namely because Netflix is still newer and growing in other parts of the world.\n\nNetflix’s Basic with Ads is $6.99 per month; ad-free it’s $9.99. Netflix’s Standard plan, which currently allows for downloading and same-time usage on two devices, is $15.49 per month, while the Premium tier that offers downloading on six devices and simultaneous usage on four devices along with enhanced audio and visuals, is $19.99.\n\nNetflix on Tuesday also announced an end to its long-running DVD program, marking an end of an era of a company that launched on the backs of red envelopes shipping movies to your doorstep. The last DVD mailer will go out on September 29.\n\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news! Sign up for our Email Newsletters here.",

This means you can expect to start paying extra to share your Netflix account with other households by the end of June.\n\n\"In Q1, we launched paid sharing in four countries and are pleased with the results,\" Netflix said. \"We are planning on a broad rollout, including in the US, in Q2.\"\n\nLoading Play\n\nNetflix first started testing the ability for users to purchase additional \"homes\" to add to their account last July. Customers in Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and the Dominican Republic were asked to pay a fee for regularly using their account outside of their home. The price of an extra home varied from country to country, but didn't cost more than $2.99 USD in any location. We don't yet know how much extra homes will cost in the U.S.\n\nNetflix also introduced a verification system in some countries that came with a warning saying, \"If you don't live with the owner of this account, you need your own account to keep watching.\"\n\nIn February, Netflix detailed its password sharing crackdown plan, highlighting a number of exceptions that will allow users to watch their account outside of the household. For example, users can request a temporary code to watch Netflix outside of their home if they're traveling. But, it seems Netflix will be paying close attention to what devices sign into Netflix accounts, and where they sign in from.\n\nNetflix is also bolstering the advertisement tier of its subscription model. Previously, the cheaper, ad-supported Netflix tier was limited to 720p.\n\n\"Given current healthy performance and trajectory of our per-member advertising economics, particularly in the US, we’re upgrading our ads experience with more streams and improved video quality to attract a broader range of consumers,\" Netflix's statement reads.\n\nThe streamer also shared subscriber numbers for Q1 2023, revealing that Netflix added 1.8 million subscribers from January to March.\n\nFor more, check out how Netflix is officially shuttering its DVD rental business.\n\nLogan Plant is a freelance writer for IGN covering video game and entertainment news.

The stock has been on a roll the last three quarters as Netflix posted an increase in net global subscriptions that, each time, significantly beat Wall Street's expectations. Netflix's recent streak of subscriber surprises come after the streaming giant struggled to add subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2021 and glaringly missed consensus expectations in the following quarterly period. Those uncharacteristic misses dramatically cut the value of the stock. But Netflix has doubled off its 52-week low as it got its subscriber mojo back. Here's a look at recent quarters' subscriber additions vs. Wall Street estimates and the subsequent stock reaction, according to Goldman Sachs data. The question for investors now is: Will Netflix be able to keep this momentum? Although the stock is seeing better days, Goldman isn't too sure. Analysts at the firm expect Netflix to report in-line to a possible slight upside in subscriber performance for the first quarter, saying they had expected the company to implement a more accelerated global crackdown on widespread password-sharing . The company's crackdown extended to just four additional markets during this period, Goldman noted. \"We believe NFLX mgmt will frame the password sharing crackdown as a longer duration initiative in 2023 that it is likely to be better aligned in specific geographies with a more robust content slate than the one seen in March 2023,\" Goldman analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in the research note that contained data on the company's subscription performance. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect the streaming giant to announce 1.38 million new memberships for the first quarter of 2023, and to post earnings per share of $2.86 on revenue of $8.18 billion. The company previously predicted that revenue growth in the first quarter of this year would rise 4%, driven by additional paid memberships and more money per paid membership. So far, the recent surge in subscriptions have proven the success of Netflix's less-expensive ad-supported plan launched in November. Although ad-supported subscribers represent 1% of Netflix's U.S. subscriber base, Goldman analysts expect this plan to attract additional members. The first quarter also marks Netflix's rollout of its paid sharing program launched in February, which allows users to pay extra to share their account with people outside of their homes. Netflix previously said it would no longer give subscriber guidance after its earnings report for the third quarter of 2022, although it will still report the numbers in future earnings reports. The company said it is prioritizing revenue as its primary top line metric rather than paid membership growth.",

                    "snippet": "Tesla (TSLA) will be a highlight of this week’s earnings lineup, set to report its first-quarter results on Wednesday, April 19.\n\nWith shares of TSLA off to a magnificent start this year, investors may be wondering if now is a good time to invest in the EV leader.\n\nLet’s see if Tesla stock is a buy right now or if there are better opportunities ahead.\n\nQ1 Preview\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla’s Q1 earnings is $0.85 per share, which would be a -20% decline from EPS of $1.07 in the prior-year quarter. Sales are expected to be up 25% at $23.56 billion Vs. $18.76 billion in Q1 2022.\n\nThe dip in Tesla’s YoY quarterly bottom line is partly attributed to higher commodity prices among raw materials like steel and aluminum in correlation with inflation. However, Tesla has also implemented several price cuts in the pricing of its EVs to boost deliveries and roll out newer models.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\n\n\nImage Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nWhile Tesla hopes its price cuts will boost demand and lead to higher sales volume, Wall Street will be closely monitoring the effect this has on the company’s earnings. To that point, many analysts are concerned that lower vehicle pricing will chip away at Tesla’s profit margins with the comany cutting its prices five times since January.\n\nTesla has now dropped the prices of its Model S sedan by roughly 5% to $89,000 and its Model X SUV by 9% to $99,000. The luxury versions of these models have also been lowered by about $5,000.\n\nWith that being said, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates Tesla should reach its Q1 earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate also at $0.85 per share.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDeliveries & Demand\n\nThe ability to continue expanding deliveries is critical during Tesla’s quarterly results. In this regard, the increasing popularity and demand for EVs may justify Tesla’s willingness to slash its prices. With demand in focus, Tesla announced earlier in the month that it delivered a quarterly record of 422,875 vehicles during the first quarter, a 36% increase from 310,000 deliveries in Q1 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis would still fall short of Wall Street’s estimates of 430,000 deliveries for the first quarter. As shown in the chart below, Tesla stock soared in its last quarterly report after beating delivery expectations but plummetted in the prior quarter when missing estimates. Still, Tesla’s ability to offer strong guidance for continued delivery growth next quarter could boost its stock.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth & Outlook\n\nTesla is still the global leader in EV sales and controls about 65% of the market share in the United States. However, monitoring Tesla’s growth is very important for investors with companies like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) looking to even the playing field.\n\nAccording to Zacks estimates, Tesla earnings are expected to dip -5% this year but rebound and climb 33% in fiscal 2024 at $5.11 per share. It is important to note that earnings estimate revisions have gone down over the last quarter.\n\nOn the top line, sales are forecasted to jump 25% in FY23 and soar another 21% in FY24 to $123.03 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would be a very stellar 401% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $24.57 billion.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPerformance & Valuation\n\nTesla stock is up an impressive +52% year to date to largely outperform the S&P 500’s +8% and the Auto Manufacturers-Domestic Markets +22%. As a loose comparison, Tesla has easily topped General Motors’ +4% and Ford’s +9% YTD performance.\n\nEven better, Tesla stock has now climbed +272% over the last three years to beat the benchmark, General Motors’ +41%, Ford’s +151%, and its Zacks Subindustry’s +88%.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares of TSLA currently trade around $187 and 48.2X forward earnings which is well below its extreme decade-long high and 78% beneath the median of 223.9X. Tesla still trades above the industry average of 10.8X but Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for the company's growth as a leader and pioneer in its space.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGoing into its Q1 report Tesla stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Tesla’s annual top and bottom line growth is still intriguing despite the decline in earnings estimates with its more reasonable P/E valuation offering support.\n\nAlthough the recent price cuts among its EVs may lead to better buying opportinuies in Tesla stock, this should also boost future demand. In this regard, investors could be rewarded for holding on to Tesla shares at current levels especially as inflation begins to ease.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Clara Chan at The Hollywood Reporter put it, is one way to drive revenue growth.\n\nBuying new DVDs have been a big recurring cost for Netflix, while making up just 0.5% of its total revenue.\n\nDetails: Netflix said that paid account sharing this year in Canada, New Zealand, Spain and Portugal has initially led to cancellations, but that over time, people ultimately activated their own accounts or added new members.\n\n\"We found enough improvement opportunities in these areas to shift a broad launch to Q2 to implement those changes,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nAs for its DVD business, Netflix says it will conclude on September 29, with final shipments.\n\nThe big picture: Netflix shares fell more than 10% after hours before rebounding. The announcements came alongside its first quarter earnings report which reflected mixed results.\n\nRevenue increased 3.7% from a year ago, and 3.9% from the fourth quarter of last year — when the streamer launched its ad-supported service.\n\nEarnings per share were $2.88, two cents higher than estimates from Refinitiv.\n\nGlobal subscribers grew by 4.9% from a year ago, or 1.75 million from the fourth quarter, for a total of 232.5 million to start the year.\n\nBe smart: Netflix last fall said it will no longer share estimates for subscriber targets as growth has tapered and it seeks to shift attention to financials.\n\nThis was also Netflix’s first quarter with Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters serving as co-CEO together. Co-founder and previous co-CEO Reed Hastings moved to executive chairman in January.\n\nGo deeper ... Netflix's earnings over the past year:",

We learn more with each rollout, and we've incorporated the latest learnings, which we think will lead to even better results,\" the company said.\n\nNetflix had initially said it would launch the program \"more broadly\" in Q1, which ended on March 31, after launching it in several countries, including New Zealand, Canada, and Spain. The program is now set to launch this quarter, which began at the start of April and runs until the end of June.\n\nThe streaming giant's plans to plow forward with its password crackdown have proven unpopular with some customers.

And Netflix NFLX, +0.29% said that its ad-supported tier is already a success.\n\nHastings, who is now only on Netflix’s board, had promised for years that Netflix would never have commercials on its service. But in October 2022, as growth started to slow after a huge pandemic surge in new subscribers, Netflix changed its tune — and so far, it may have been the right move to get more revenue growth.\n\n“So think of this as kind of that next step in our evolution, of a bit of a better market fit, product market fit, pricing fit, with the aim of growing our penetration in these markets,” Peters said in the company’s recorded analyst interview Tuesday.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, company executives said the ads plan in the U.S., when combining the subscription price and commercials, “already has a total ARM [average revenue per membership] … greater than our standard plan.”\n\nThe streaming company no longer gives guidance on subscriber additions, which was another sign that its former stellar growth rates are over. In the first quarter, Netflix said that average paid memberships grew 4%, while its average revenue per membership declined 1%. But new subscribers came in below analysts’ expectations: Netflix gained 1.75 million subscribers in the quarter, down from the 2.2 million adds expected by Wall Street.\n\nPassword sharing was also something that Netflix never cared about in the past, even tweeting in 2017: “Love is sharing a password.” But after announcing a crackdown last year, Netflix has begun what Peters said was an “important transition” regarding password sharing in Latin America and Canada, and he said the company was trying to go about it “as thoughtfully as we can.”\n\nOnce it detects a customer is sharing an account, Netflix’s approach so far has been to “remind people what that looks like, very much like a price increase,” Peters said. “We see an initial cancel reaction, and then we build out of that both in terms of membership and revenue as borrowers sign up for their own Netflix accounts and existing members purchase that extra member facility for folks they want to share with.”\n\nNetflix will launch an improved version of its system to crack down on password-sharing in the second quarter and it will include U.S. customers, he said.\n\nIt is becoming pretty clear that the old Netflix — the Netflix of Hastings that didn’t care about ads or if you shared your password with a friend — is gone. How many of those viewers who use others’ passwords will actually convert to paid subscribers is still a big guess, and investors will hopefully learn more next quarter.\n\nNetflix proved years ago that it can evolve, as it switched from DVDs to becoming a streaming pioneer. Now it has to change its business model once again. Investors will have to change their expectations as well, focusing on how Netflix acquires and monetizes subscribers, as they are unlikely to see the era of hyper growth ever return.",

                    "snippet": "Netflix’s long-awaited crackdown on password sharing is coming soon to the U.S., the streamer said on Tuesday.\n\nNetflix originally planned to roll out “paid sharing” in the States during the first quarter of 2023. However, Netflix now says it’ll start rolling out the change — an update designed to convert account-sharers into paying users — a little later, on or before June 30.\n\nThis move is not limited to the U.S., either. “We are planning on a broad rollout, including in the US, in Q2,” the streamer said in its first-quarter 2023 earnings report. Alongside this announcement, Netflix also bid farewell to its 25-year-old mail-order DVD business. RIP.\n\nNetflix’s quest to boost revenues by curbing password sharing kicked off earlier this year in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain. In these countries, Netflix requires paying users to set a “primary location” for their account. Going forward, if someone they don’t live with uses their account, Netflix alerts them to “buy an extra member.” Netflix says it will allow up to two extra members per account, and its fee per extra user varies by country. For example, it’s an additional CAD $7.99 in Canada and €3.99 in Portugal.\n\nSpeaking of revenue, Netflix fell short of analysts’ expectations for its first quarter of the year. The company said it brought in $8.16 billion during Q1 2023, while Wall Street anticipated a slightly higher figure — $8.18 billion. However, the firm reported higher-than-expected earnings of $2.88 per share in Q1; analysts had anticipated $2.86 per share.\n\nEarlier in 2023, Netflix breezily summarized its paid-sharing update as a chance to clarify “confusion about when and how you can share Netflix,” but make no mistake, this is a crackdown. On Tuesday, Netflix played a similar tune, telling investors that the change “will result in a better outcome for both our members and our business.”\n\n“We see a cancel reaction in each market when we announce the news, which impacts near-term member growth,” Netflix said. “But as borrowers start to activate their own accounts and existing members add ‘extra member’ accounts, we see increased acquisition and revenue.”\n\nNetflix ended regular trading with its stock price at $333.70 per share. After hours, the company’s individual share price slipped below $307, before rebounding to about $330 (as of 2:58 p.m. PT).",

                    "snippet": "Netflix will end its DVD-by-mail service\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael Liedtke/AP Michael Liedtke/AP\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Netflix is poised to shut down the DVD-by-mail rental service that set the stage for its trailblazing video streaming service, ending an era that began a quarter century ago when delivering discs through the mail was considered a revolutionary concept.\n\nThe DVD service, which still delivers films and TV shows in the red-and-white envelopes that once served as Netflix's emblem, plans to mail its final discs on Sept. 29.\n\nNetflix ended March with 232.5 million worldwide subscribers to its video streaming service, but it stopped disclosing how many people still pay for DVD-by-mail delivery years ago as that part of its business steadily shrank. The DVD service generated $145.7 million in revenue last year, which translated into somewhere between 1.1 million and 1.3 million subscribers, based on the average prices paid by customers.\n\nThe growth of Netflix's video streaming service has been slowing down over the past year, prompting management to put more emphasis on boosting profits. That focus may have also contributed to the decision to close an operation that was becoming a financial drain.\n\nBut the DVD service was once Netflix's biggest money maker.\n\nShortly before Netflix broke it off from video streaming in 2011, the DVD-by-mail service boasted more than 16 million subscribers. That number has steadily dwindled and the service's eventual demise became apparent as the idea of waiting for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver entertainment became woefully outdated.\n\nBut the DVD-by-mail service still has die-hard fans who continue to subscribe because they treasure finding obscure movies that are aren't widely available on video streaming. Many subscribers still wax nostalgic about opening their mailbox and seeing the familiar red-and-white envelopes awaiting them instead of junk mail and a stack of bills.\n\n\"Those iconic red envelopes changed the way people watched shows and movies at home — and they paved the way for the shift to streaming,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos wrote in a blog post about the DVD service's forthcoming shutdown.\n\nThe service's history dates back to 1997 when Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph went to a post office in Santa Cruz, California, to mail a Patsy Cline compact disc to his friend and fellow co-founder Reed Hastings. Randolph, Netflix's original CEO, wanted to test whether a disc could be delivered through the U.S. Postal Service without being damaged, hoping eventually to do the same thing with the still-new format that became the DVD.\n\nThe Patsy Cline CD arrived at Hastings' home unblemished, prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a DVD-by-mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology.\n\n\"It was planned obsolescence, but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time,\" Randolph said in an interview with The Associated Press last year across the street from the Santa Cruz post office where he mailed the Patsy Cline CD. Hastings replaced Randolph as Netflix's CEO a few years after its inception, a job he didn't relinquish until stepping down in January.\n\nWith just a little over five months of life remaining, the DVD service has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the U.S. — the only country in which it ever operated. Its ending echoes the downfall of the thousands of Blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn't counter the threat posed by Netflix's DVD-by-mail alternative.\n\nEven subscribers who remain loyal to the DVD service could see the end coming as they noticed the shrinking selection in a library that once boasted more than 100,000 titles. Some customers also have reported having to wait longer for discs to be delivered as Netflix closed dozens of DVD distribution centers with the shift to streaming.\n\n\"Our goal has always been to provide the best service for our members but as the business continues to shrink that's going to become increasingly difficult,\" Sarandos acknowledged in his blog post.\n\nNetflix rebranded the rental service as DVD.com — a prosaic name that was settled upon after Hastings floated the idea of calling it Qwikster, an idea that was widely ridiculed. The DVD service has been operating from a non-descript office in Fremont, California, located about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Netflix's sleek campus in Los Gatos, California.",

                    "top_image": "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1478297091-e1681850329238.jpg?resize=1200,600",
                    "snippet": "Netflix got off to a slow start to the year, missing Wall Street estimates after adding only 1.75 million customers in the first quarter and stoking concerns about the future of the world’s most popular TV network. Investors were expecting 2.41 million new customers.\n\nNetflix also predicted on Tuesday that it will generate lower sales and profit in the current quarter than what analysts forecast. The company delayed its plan to crack down on password sharing in the US. It sees new customers in the current period as “roughly similar” to the first quarter.\n\nShares of Netflix fell as much as 12% to $294.80 in extended trading after the results were announced.\n\nThis is the second year in a row where Netflix has gotten off to a shaky start. Shares of Netflix have slipped more than 50% from their high in November 2021 as the company has gone from a high-flying phenom to a middle-aged star searching for its next big hit. The streaming service lost customers in the first half of 2022 and added fewer than 9 million customers for the full 12 months, its slowest pace since 2011, the year it split its streaming service from its DVD-by-mail business.\n\nNetflix said Tuesday it is shutting down its DVD delivery operation, ending its original business after a 25-year run. The company cited the cost of operating it after years of seeking customers move online.\n\nThe streaming industry pioneer has responded to its slowing growth by introducing two new initiatives: an advertising-supported tier and a plan to crack down on password sharing. The company estimates that more than 100 million people use a Netflix account for which they don’t pay.\n\nThe company has been testing ways of charging customers for sharing accounts in Latin America, and rolled out plans in four territories in the first quarter. It said it would begin to charge for password sharing in the US, its largest market, in the next couple months. Analysts see this as a large potential source of new customers.\n\n“Widespread account sharing undermines our ability to invest in and improve Netflix for our paying members, as well as build our business,” the company said in a statement to investors. “We’re pleased with the results of our Q1 launches in Canada, New Zealand, Spain and Portugal, strengthening our confidence that we have the right approach.”\n\nThe advertising tier debuted in November but has yet to contribute a material number of subscribers. The company had said that both advertising and password sharing will offer modest contributions in the first quarter of the year but would pick up in the current period.\n\nCracking down on password sharing will also cause some customers to stop using the service in the short term. Netflix’s challenge is to get them to pay for their own account, which would accelerate growth in markets like the US and Latin America.\n\nForeign territories accounted for almost all of Netflix’s growth in the quarter. The service added just 100,000 customers in the US and Canada after losing almost 1 million customers last year. The Asia-Pacific region continues to be Netflix’s bigger source of new customers. The service added 1.46 million customers there in the quarter, thanks in part to lowering prices in India. It lost subscribers in Latin America, a development that could be the result of the crackdown on password sharing.\n\nNetflix is still the most popular TV network in the US by a good margin. It accounts for more than 7% of all TV viewing in the US each month, according to Nielsen, more than double any paid service. It also tops linear networks, according to CBS. Netflix released several new hits in the quarter, including new seasons of Ginny & Georgia and Outer Banks, the new show The Night Agent and the film You People.\n\nThe company has urged investors to stop fixating on its subscriber additions and instead look at traditional financial metrics like sales and profit. But Wall Street has long treated Netflix like a growth stock, giving it a higher valuation than its peers in media because of its long-term potential.\n\nThat potential is largely predicated on the number of people who use Netflix.",

                    "snippet": "Choosing tomorrow's stock market winners isn't easy. But we do have some elements that can help us identify stocks with great potential. For instance, a company with brand strength and a plan to spur a new phase of growth. That describes Disney (DIS 0.63%) today. Another key element is progress when it comes to earnings. Chewy (CHWY -3.00%) fits the bill here.\n\nDisney and Chewy have dropped 23% and 14%, respectively, over the past year. That makes them look pretty cheap considering growth prospects. And that means right now is a great time to get in on these stories -- before the stock prices take off. Let's take a closer look at each.\n\n1. Disney\n\nSome investors turned away from Disney shares last year as costs mounted at the entertainment giant. The company added subscribers to its streaming services -- but the unit's operating loss widened. So, Disney brought back longtime chief executive officer Bob Iger to pave a new path to growth.\n\nIger is putting the focus on creativity, and he's reorganizing departments and cutting jobs. He's aiming for $5.5 billion in cost savings. Iger has two years to complete his task and then hand the reins over to a new CEO. There's reason to be confident. Iger led Disney through successful moves like the launch of animated film Frozen and the acquisitions of Pixar and Marvel. Disney's share price also climbed during Iger's previous tenure.\n\nDIS data by YCharts\n\nIt's also important to remember Disney's biggest revenue driver still is posting solid results. I'm talking about the parks, experiences, and products unit. It reported double-digit increases in revenue and operating income in the most recent quarter. And trends here are looking positive. The company said Disney World and Disneyland attendance is higher today than it was a year ago. The unit's domestic operating margins also improved in the quarter -- even considering headwinds like higher inflation.\n\nDisney shares today are trading for 24 times forward earnings estimates -- down from more than 32 late last year. If Iger reaches his goals, the price could soar from here.\n\n2. Chewy\n\nChewy is an online paradise for animal lovers. You can shop there for food, treats, and toys for your pet. And you can go to Chewy for healthcare needs such as online vet visits and pet insurance. The company serves the U.S. market but recently announced plans to expand internationally.\n\nAll of this has led to earnings growth for the pet care giant. Chewy announced record profitability, revenue, and free cash flow in its most recent earnings report. The company reported its first ever full year of profit, at more than $49 million in the fiscal year that ended in January. Gross margin reached 28%. And free cash flow topped $119 million.\n\nChewy has come a long way in just four years. Over that period, revenue has increased to $10 billion from $3.5 billion. And gross margin has climbed from 20%.\n\nBut there's a lot more to come for Chewy. First, the company is working on ways to continue improving margins and satisfy customers. That's by revamping the supply chain. Chewy started investing in fulfillment center automation a few years ago, a great way to improve productivity. Second, the $130 billion U.S. pet market offers Chewy plenty of room for growth over time.\n\nToday, Chewy shares are trading for 1.4 times sales, down from more than 7 back in 2021 -- when the company wasn't even profitable. This looks like a bargain for a stock that has what it takes to advance over time.",

(AP) — New Jersey residents looking to buy or lease an electric vehicle won’t be able to get a government rebate — at least temporarily — because the state program is so popular that it's already running out of money, officials said.\n\nThe Charge Up New Jersey program has disbursed an estimated $35 million for the fiscal year ending this July, according to the state's Board of Public Utilities. The board said Monday it was putting the program on pause because all the earmarked funding will soon be disbursed, based on current rate of application approvals and eligible vehicle orders.\n\nNow in its third year, the program gives state residents up to $4,000 right when they buy or lease a new electric vehicle. On average, EVs now cost more than $58,000, according to Kelley Blue Book, a price that’s beyond the reach of many U.S. households. Federal tax credits and other incentives are designed to bring prices down and attract more buyers.\n\nNew Jersey's utility board estimates the program will support the purchase or lease of more than 10,000 vehicles this fiscal year, and it should be back up and running again once the new fiscal year starts July 1. A spokesperson for the Board of Public Utilities, Peter Peretzman, said Tuesday he wasn't sure if there are plans to increase the program's funding for next fiscal year.\n\nThe utility board estimates that the program, since its launch in May 2020, will have provided more than $90 million in incentives for leasing or buying nearly 25,000 EVs.\n\nPolitical Cartoons View All 949 Images\n\nAt the end of the 2022 there were more than 91,000 electric vehicles on the state's roadways, the board said, and EVs made up 8% of all new car sales in New Jersey last year.\n\nNew Jersey is among the states that have found success with electric vehicle incentive programs. A rebate program in Oregon will also have to pause next month because too many people are applying and the program is running out of money.\n\nThe Biden administration has proposed stiff automobile pollution limits that would require up to two-thirds of new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2032, a nearly tenfold increase over current electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe proposed regulation, announced last week by the Environmental Protection Agency, would set tailpipe emissions limits for the 2027 through 2032 model years that are the strictest ever imposed. The proposed tailpipe pollution limits don’t require a specific number of electric vehicles to be sold every year but instead mandate limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Depending on how automakers comply, the EPA projects that at least 60% of new passenger vehicles sold in the U.S. would be electric by 2030 and up to 67% by 2032.\n\nStill, a new poll released last week shows that many Americans aren’t yet sold on going electric for their next cars, with high prices and too few charging stations the main deterrents.\n\nEnvironmental groups say stricter tailpipe pollution standards are needed to clean the air we breathe and prevent the worst of climate change’s future harms, including even more extreme weather events.",

The board said Monday it was putting the program on pause because all the earmarked funding will soon be disbursed, based on current rate of application approvals and eligible vehicle orders.\n\nNow in its third year, the program gives state residents up to $4,000 right when they buy or lease a new electric vehicle. On average, EVs now cost more than $58,000, according to Kelley Blue Book, a price that’s beyond the reach of many U.S. households. Federal tax credits and other incentives are designed to bring prices down and attract more buyers.\n\nNew Jersey’s utility board estimates the program will support the purchase or lease of more than 10,000 vehicles this fiscal year, and it should be back up and running again once the new fiscal year starts July 1. A spokesperson for the Board of Public Utilities, Peter Peretzman, said Tuesday he wasn’t sure if there are plans to increase the program’s funding for next fiscal year.\n\nThe utility board estimates that the program, since its launch in May 2020, will have provided more than $90 million in incentives for leasing or buying nearly 25,000 EVs.\n\nAt the end of the 2022 there were more than 91,000 electric vehicles on the state’s roadways, the board said, and EVs made up 8% of all new car sales in New Jersey last year.\n\nNew Jersey is among the states that have found success with electric vehicle incentive programs. A rebate program in Oregon will also have to pause next month because too many people are applying and the program is running out of money.\n\nThe Biden administration has proposed stiff automobile pollution limits that would require up to two-thirds of new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2032, a nearly tenfold increase over current electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe proposed regulation, announced last week by the Environmental Protection Agency, would set tailpipe emissions limits for the 2027 through 2032 model years that are the strictest ever imposed. The proposed tailpipe pollution limits don’t require a specific number of electric vehicles to be sold every year but instead mandate limits on greenhouse gas emissions.

                    "snippet": "Car shoppers no longer have to guess which hybrid or electric vehicles qualify for a federal tax credit this year, with the U.S. issuing new guidelines this week. Here's what to know if you're considering buying an electric car.\n\nWhich cars qualify?\n\nIt's a short list. Only about a dozen vehicles qualify for the full $7,500 tax break — all from U.S. car makers.\n\nFour hybrid vehicles and three EVs — the Ford Escape, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeep Wrangler, Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring, Ford E-Transit, Mustang Mach-E and Tesla Model 3 Standard Range — are eligible for a $3,750 credit. Customers who buy a used EV are eligible for a $4,000 credit.\n\nThe following electric vehicles qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit:\n\nCadillac Lyriq\n\nChevrolet Blazer\n\nChevrolet Bolt & Bolt EUV\n\nChevrolet Equinox\n\nChevrolet Silverado\n\nFord F-150 Lightning (both standard and extended range battery)\n\nTesla Model 3\n\nTesla Model Y (both all-wheel and long range drives)\n\nCustomers who purchase those cars can apply the tax credit to their 2023 tax return. Starting next year, drivers can transfer the credit to a dealership, lowering the vehicle's purchase price.\n\nWhich EVs don't qualify, and why?\n\nTo qualify for the tax credit, federal guidelines now stipulate that the purchased EV must have 50% of the value of its battery components produced in North America, and 40% of the value of minerals used to make the vehicle itself must be extracted domestically.\n\nFailing to meet those criteria eliminated more than a dozen vehicles from eligibility for the tax break. These EVs and hybrids no longer qualify:\n\nBMW 330e\n\nNissan Leaf models — including the S, S Plus, SL Plus, SV and SV Plus\n\nVolvo S60 models — including the Extended Range and T8 Recharge\n\nAudi Q5 TFSI e Quattro\n\nBMW X5\n\nChrysler Pacifica\n\n\n\nFord Escape Plug-In\n\nLincoln Aviator Grand Touring\n\nRivian R1S\n\nRivian R1T\n\nVolkswagen ID.4 models — including the Pro, Pro S, S, AWD Pro and AWD Pro S\n\nWhat other factors affect the EV tax credit?\n\nYour income and the price you paid for an electric vehicle also play a part in whether you land the tax credit. Drivers are eligible as long as the EV's sticker price is less than $55,000 for sedans and no more than $80,000 for SUVs and vans. Also, people with a gross income over $150,000 are disqualified; for married couples, the cutoff is a combined income of $300,000.\n\nHow will the new rules impact the EV market?\n\nDealerships will almost immediately start marketing the tax credit benefits on the eligible models they have on the lot, Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, told CBS MoneyWatch. This will likely help boost sales for the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup and Tesla Model 3 sedan, he said.\n\nAlthough foreign automakers will likely try to move some of their EV manufacturing to the U.S. so their cars qualify for the tax credit, Drury expects that process to take years. For now, the new guidance makes it easier for car buyers.\n\n\"The most homework consumers will have to do now is visiting the EPA site or fueleconomy.gov or a dealership's website,\" he said. \"The last few months have been this strange gray area where Tesla started hacking away at its prices, and so did Ford. This clears up a lot of confusion, and now people can actually plan.\"\n\nWill this lower EV prices?\n\nYes, but not immediately. Over the longer term, government tax subsidies and the declining cost of building EVs should make it easier for automakers to offer prices that are more competitive with traditional fuel-injected cars.\n\nIn March, the average new EV sold for $58,940, according to Kelley Blue Book. But Tesla, GM and other automakers have committed to offer electric cars that cost less than $30,000 in the not-too-distant future.\n\nPrices are eventually likely to drop because \"margins are starting to improve for these electric vehicles,\" Tom Narayan, the lead equity analyst for Global Autos at RBC Capital Markets, told CBS News.\n\n\"Remember, when they [EVs] started coming out, these automakers were losing money on them,\" he noted.\n\n\"We've scaled to a point where we can start thinking about the next step in the evolution of EVs,\" Narayan said.",

Right now, only six fully electric vehicles qualify for the full $7,500 EV tax credit, with three more from Chevrolet coming for the 2024 model year (we would expect these 2024 models to roll out slowly and be difficult to find for at least the first few months they are on the market). In addition to those six fully electric cars, two plug-in hybrids also qualify for the full $7,500 credit.\n\nTo qualify, a vehicle must be assembled in North America and must meet a strict set of guidelines that cover where battery materials were sourced. If any battery materials come from certain countries (importantly including China), the vehicle's tax credit is automatically cut in half. Further, according to the IRS, the vehicle's manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) can't exceed $80,000 for vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks or $55,000 for any other type of vehicle (basically meaning sedans).\n\nElectric vehicles that qualify for the full $7,500 EV tax credit:\n\nPlug-in hybrid cars that qualify for the full $7,500 EV tax credit:\n\nChrysler Pacifica PHEV (2022-2023)\n\nLincoln Aviator Grand Touring (2022-2023)\n\nA smaller credit is offered on fully electric cars and plug-in hybrids that are assembled in North America but have batteries with materials sourced from unqualified countries (mostly China).\n\nElectric cars that qualify for a $3,750 EV tax credit:\n\nFord E-Transit (2022-2023)\n\nFord Mustang Mach-E -- all models (2022-2023)\n\nTesla Model 3 Standard Range Rear Wheel Drive (2022-2023)\n\nPlug-in hybrid cars that qualify for a $3,750 EV tax credit:\n\nFord Escape Plug-in Hybrid (2022-2023)\n\nJeep Grand Cherokee PHEV 4xe (2022-2023)\n\nJeep Wrangler PHEV 4xe (2022-2023)\n\nLincoln Corsair Grand Touring (2022-2023)\n\nAs of April 18, 2023, that's the full list of electric cars and plug-in hybrids that qualify for either the full or half EV tax credit. Notable vehicles that qualified from January 1 through April 17 that no longer qualify for any tax credit include the Nissan Leaf, Genesis Electrified GV70, Rivian R1S and R1T, and Volkswagen ID.4. Notably, the Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Rear Wheel Drive also previously qualified for the full EV tax credit, but now only gets a half credit due to battery materials sourced from China. It is the only Tesla Model 3 that uses such a battery; all other Tesla Model 3 models still get the full EV tax credit.\n\nIt should be noted that this list is current as of April 18, 2023, but is subject to change at any time. The IRS offers guidance to automakers on the requirements to qualify for a tax credit, and automakers could make changes to their production vehicles that cause them to gain or lose a credit.\n\nRelated video:",

                    "snippet": "The Biden administration, pushing for more U.S. manufacturing, has issued its updated list of all-electric and gas-electric hybrid vehicles that qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit, and those that can earn at least a partial sweetener for buyers.\n\nWith the update, at least 17 models are now eligible for a full or partial tax credit, based on new thresholds that require a certain percentage of the battery parts and the minerals used in those batteries to come from North America, meaning the U.S., or a country with select trade agreements with the U.S.\n\nIt’s best to look at the complete list to see which versions of a particular model will qualify.\n\nThe total is down from more than two dozen electric and plug-in models previously eligible for a U.S. tax break, which were first introduced about 10 years ago.\n\nQualified vehicles purchased before 2023 may be eligible for a similar tax credit of up to $7,500.\n\nThe revision limits the selection to vehicles built by four car companies: Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.46% , Ford Motor Co. F, +0.39% , General Motors Co. GM, +0.54% and Stellantis NV STLA, +0.54% , which owns Jeep and Chrysler.\n\nSee the full list.\n\nThe government site also advises on tax incentives for used vehicles and leased vehicles.\n\nFor buyers to claim the full $7,500 tax credit, a percentage of the pre-determined battery parts must be made in North America and a percentage of critical minerals sourced in the U.S. or from certain trade-friendly countries. A partial $3,750 credit is available for meeting one of these two battery-sourcing requirements.\n\nTerrence Horan\n\nNot a single electric model from a foreign brand is eligible for the subsidy as revised. And EVs from startups, such as passenger- and commercial-truck maker Rivian Automotive Inc. RIVN, -2.18% and luxury brand Lucid Group Inc. LCID, -1.51% , also missed making the list. That’s largely because their vehicles are too expensive for the price contingencies that inform which autos qualify. Income levels of buyers are also a consideration.\n\nStill, the new rules make for certain immediate winners over others.\n\nNearly all of GM’s new EV models are eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit. Six Ford electric and plug-in hybrid models also qualify for a partial or full tax credit, including the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning.\n\nAmong Tesla’s models, some entry-level Model 3 sedans will get a $3,750 credit. That is because the car uses battery cells made in China. Higher-end Model 3s and all its Model Y configurations qualify for the full $7,500 credit.\n\nTesla has been cutting its retail prices, a move to boost sales and bring some offerings in line with the tax breaks. And analysts say the maker likely isn’t done cutting prices.\n\nThe tax credits made a big splash when they were included in 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act, the broad spending bill that observers labeled the biggest pro-climate action by an administration to date. But Biden’s pro-America stance soon came in conflict with the heart of the existing EV market, much of which is sourced abroad.\n\nRead: Biden adds more EV charging across U.S., with pledges from Uber, Walmart, PG&E and others\n\nThe latest changes, which are intended to attract auto manufacturers into building domestically, apply to vehicles delivered to customers starting Tuesday. Several overseas makers, including Hyundai and Honda, have started to build battery plants in the U.S.\n\nOther actions are intended to push EVs as well. The Environmental Protection Agency last week proposed its toughest restrictions ever on tailpipe emissions, a target that can likely only be met by turning out more EVs from assembly lines. The new standards aim for two-thirds of U.S. car sales to be electric by 2032.",

For passenger cars, the manufacturer's suggested retail price, or MSRP, must be $55,000 or less. For vans, SUVs and light trucks, the ceiling is $80,000.\n\nStarting in 2024, the credit can be implemented at the point of sale as \"cash on the hood,\" meaning you can apply it toward the purchase price of your vehicle.\n\nAlso starting next year, vehicles that contain battery parts from \"a foreign entity of concern\" -- a classification that includes China and Russia -- will be unable to claim any of the credit. For critical minerals, the cutoff is 2025.\n\nThere is also a ceiling on the adjusted gross income to qualify for the credit.\n\nIncome cap for EV tax credit Filing status Income Single $150,000 Head of household $225,000 Married, filing jointly $300,000 Married, filing separately $150,000\n\nFor the most part, these changes took effect on Jan. 1, 2023, and will remain in effect until Jan. 1, 2032. Always check the IRS website for updates.\n\nCan I claim the tax credit on a used EV?\n\n\n\nBeginning in 2023, plug-in electric or fuel-cell EVs can qualify for a credit of up to 30% of its purchase price, maxing out at $4,000.\n\n\n\nThere are certain restrictions:\n\nThe used EV tax credit can only be claimed once in a vehicle's lifetime. Subsequent owners will not be eligible.\n\nThe MSRP of the car must be $25,000 or less.\n\nThe car must be at least 2 years old. If you bought it in 2023, it must be from model year 2021 or earlier.\n\nUsed vehicles purchased before 2023 are not eligible.\n\nThe vehicle must have been purchased from a qualified dealer who reports the transaction to the IRS.\n\nThe vehicle must otherwise meet the requirements for the EV credit.\n\nBelow are income caps for owners of used EVs wishing to claim the credit.\n\nUsed EV income cap Filing status Modified adjusted gross income Single $75,000 Head of household $112,500 Married, filing jointly $150,000 Married, filing separately $75,000\n\nHow do I claim the EV tax credit?\n\nTo claim the credit for an EV you took possession of in 2022, file IRS Form 8936 with your 2022 tax return. (You will need to provide the VIN for your vehicle.)\n\nDo individual states have EV tax incentives?\n\nIn addition to the federal EV tax credit, a number of states offer rebates for clean vehicles. Some can't be taken in conjunction with the federal credit, so be sure to get all the information before claiming anything.\n\nCalifornia's Clean Vehicle Rebate Project offers credits of between $1,000 and $7,000 for the purchase or lease of certain new EVs, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles.\n\n\n\nEnergySage, an online marketplace for home solar-energy solutions, has a list of state rebate programs.\n\nThe Energy Department's Alternative Fuels Data Center has information on various incentives offered by states, utilities and private organizations.\n\nDo I get a tax credit for installing an EV charger?\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also extended the tax break for residential charging systems through 2032 and made it retroactive to Jan. 1, 2022.\n\nIt's worth $1,000, or 30% of the cost of buying or installing the system, whichever is less.\n\nThe credit now also applies to bidirectional charging equipment, which lets you use your EV to power other appliances or even your home. Not many models have that capability, but it can be handy in an outage or other emergency.\n\n\n\nTo claim the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit, you must file IRS Form 8911.\n\nFor more on EVs, find out how you can finance a home EV charger and get under the hood with Tesla's new EV motor.",

                    "snippet": "Uwe Krejci | Digitalvision | Getty Images\n\nThe number of new electric vehicles eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit fell by almost half on Tuesday, as new rules issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury took effect. However, consumers in the market for an electric passenger vehicle can still access a tax break by instead buying a used EV or leasing a vehicle, experts said.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act's EV requirements\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 at the White House on Aug. 16, 2022. Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty Images\n\nNow, 22 cars from seven car companies — Cadillac, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Ford, Jeep, Lincoln and Tesla — qualify for at least a partial tax break, about half the number of the original list. Cars manufactured by Audi, BMW, Genesis, Nissan, Rivian, Volkswagen and Volvo no longer qualify for the time being, according to the Energy Department list. Price-conscious consumers who want to buy an electric car or truck and claim a tax break — but don't see a car they like on the existing list of qualifying new EVs — have other avenues, which come with fewer restrictions.\n\nA $4,000 tax credit for used EVs\n\nwatch now\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also created a tax credit for consumers who buy used electric or fuel-cell vehicles. The tax break for used cars, which took effect this year, is worth $4,000 or 30% of the sale price, whichever is less. This \"previously owned clean vehicles credit\" doesn't carry any of the manufacturing rules tied to new EVs, making it a potential workaround for consumers who are in the market for an electric vehicle and want to maximize their tax savings.\n\nHalfpoint Images | Moment | Getty Images\n\n\"If the new vehicle you want isn't eligible [for the $7,500 credit], you might be able to save some money [by buying a used EV] and get a tax credit,\" said Ingrid Malmgren, policy director at Plug In America. The used vehicle credit applies to a broad selection of cars, she said. Consumers can consult an IRS list to verify which used vehicles qualify. Here are some of the criteria for cars and consumers to qualify for the credit: The car must be purchased from a licensed dealer.\n\nThe model year must be at least 2 years old.\n\nThe sale price must be $25,000 or less.\n\nIt's only available to individuals, not businesses.\n\nBuyers are ineligible for a credit if their annual income exceeds certain thresholds: $75,000 for singles, $112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for married couples filing a joint tax return. Buyers assess income for the year in which they acquired the car or the prior year, whichever is less. (Income is measured as \"modified adjusted gross income.\" You can consult these FAQs to determine how to calculate modified AGI.) Those income limits are \"much lower\" than the one that applies to the $7,500 tax credit for new vehicles, said Katherine Breaks, a managing director in KPMG's tax credit and energy advisory services group. The income thresholds associated with new cars are double those for used EVs. Both the new and used credits are nonrefundable, meaning car buyers need to have a tax liability to get any value from the tax breaks.\n\n\"If I don't have $4,000 of tax liability, what's the tax credit worth to me? Not much,\" Breaks said of the used vehicle credit. Starting in 2024, however, a new mechanism will kick in for new and used cars whereby buyers can transfer their tax credits to dealers — perhaps allowing dealers to turn the tax break into a point-of-sale discount for consumers instead of a benefit that can only be claimed when filing an annual tax return, experts said. The IRS plans to issue additional guidance about this transfer provision.\n\nA tax break for leased EVs\n\nAlternatively, consumers also appear poised to get a tax break worth up to $7,500 for leasing new electric passenger vehicles. This tax benefit doesn't carry the manufacturing requirements attached to purchases of new cars, Malmgren said. That means a larger number of vehicles are likely to qualify at first — making the provision somewhat of a loophole for consumers who'd like to lease a car.\n\nMaskot | Maskot | Getty Images",

                    "snippet": "The great debate regarding AM radio is firing up, as more automakers ditch the old school feature. Whereas some people grew up with AM radio, others have never even used it. Regardless, automakers have been phasing out AM radios in their cars for a while.\n\n“So, what I can definitely tell you is that the situation is evolving,” said Robert Galloway, president of Sam Galloway Ford. “It’s very, very fluid. There’s a handful of vehicles that have been recently announced that they won’t be carrying AM frequency any longer.”\n\nFord Motor Company is one of several manufacturers gearing up to ditch AM radio in some of its 2024 electric models due to poor signals and audio quality, as a result of interference from high-voltage components.\n\n“For us, it would be our Mustang Mach-E and our F-150 Lightning, and the conversation was that the electric engines were causing an electromagnetic interference with the AM frequencies,” Galloway said.\n\nBMW, Mazda, Tesla, Volkswagen, and Volvo are some of the other major companies saying goodbye to AM in their EVs.\n\n“The phasing out of AM feels similar to the way 8-tracks, cassettes, CDs, had all been phased out,” Galloway said. “I think a lot of it’s just due to consumer demand.”\n\nBut, there’s much more at stake, according to a handful of former and current U.S. leaders. In February, seven former FEMA members sent a letter to the Department of Transportation advocating for AM. They believe it’s a critical public safety tool used by federal, state, and local officials during natural disasters.\n\n“AM radio has been the backbone of emergency frequencies and emergency communications for a very long time in this country,” said Brock Long, former FEMA administrator (2017-2019).\n\nLong went on to say that a failure in communication can exacerbate or increase the complexity of disasters. He believes certain car companies began throwing out AM radio without understanding the ramifications of the Emergency Alert System that FEMA is in charge of operating.\n\n“If you notice in Florida, particularly South Florida, a lot of the hurricane evacuation information is put forward through AM radio,” Long said. “And Kellie, the reason behind that is because AM radio operates at a much lower frequency, and it has the ability to push through solid structures, it has the ability to penetrate deep, far and wide.”\n\nAutomakers argue that drivers can still access AM on their smartphones, but Long said that won’t cut it in times of disaster.\n\n“You can stream AM radio on a cell phone if the communication towers are operational, but we’ve seen in large scale disasters, Puerto Rico, Maria, where all of the cell phone technology was down and out for days, if not months, in some places,” Long said.\n\nSenator Edward Markey of Massachusetts also has spoken out about the changes. In December, he sent a letter to 20 car manufacturers requesting that they maintain AM radio in their vehicles. In addition, FCC Commissioner Nathan Simington echoed the thoughts expressed by the former FEMA members in their letter to the Department of Transportation.\n\nThe car industry is modernizing at record speed, especially when it comes to the creation of EVs. A handful of automakers plan to follow-through with the phasing out of AM. But, a handful of other companies, such as Honda, Toyota, and Nissan, haven’t raced to make any changes.\n\nU.S. leaders advocating for AM believe the changes will become especially problematic as more and more people transition to electric vehicles. After all, the Biden Administration has been clear about its goal of making 50-percent of all new vehicles on the road electric by 2030.\n\n\n\nPlease click here to upgrade to a newer browser.

Australian customers will love it!”\n\nThe all-electric @Ford Puma is heading to Australia! This will be our 4th EV launching down under before the end of 2024. Australian customers will love it! ⚡️ #FordPuma https://t.co/IPesVddpAw pic.twitter.com/yW9gOT0ea1 — Jim Farley (@jimfarley98) April 18, 2023\n\nThe Ford Puma is a popular light SUV in Australia. It received awards for the Best Light SUV from Drive for 3 consecutive years. Ford still needs to unveil the Puma EV to the public, so little is known about the electric vehicle. But it seems fitting that Ford starts ramping up its EV sales in Australia with an electric version of the Puma—and the Ford Mustang Mach-E, of course.\n\nFarley also reminded the public of the Mustang Mach-E’s launch in Australia, expected later this year. Ford Australia’s Mustang Mach-E page states that vehicle reservations will open soon. On its order page, the American carmaker asks customers to “register interest” for the Mustang Mach-E, so Ford should be prepared to accommodate Australia’s reservations.\n\nThe legacy automaker also teased the launch of the pure-electric E-Transit and E-Transit Custom vans. The all-electric E-Transit van is expected to arrive down under by April 2023.\n\nWith the Puma EV, E-Transit, E-Transit Custom, and Mustang Mach-E, Ford has revealed 4 out of 5 of the electric vehicles in its lineup for Australia. The fifth Ford EV to hit Australia is still a mystery. There have been zero hints that it will be the F-150 Lightning.\n\n“F-150 Lighting is a game-changing vehicle but only available in left-hand drive so we have no news to share about any plans to introduce it in Australia,” said a Ford Australia spokesperson.\n\nThe Teslarati team would appreciate hearing from you.

Frederic J. Brown | AFP | Getty Images\n\nFewer electric vehicles now qualify for federal tax credits after the Biden administration this week unveiled stricter rules for battery sources that will prioritize domestically manufactured models. The new list published by the Treasury Department includes 16 U.S. manufactured models from Ford , General Motors , Tesla and Stellantis . Ten of the models on the new list will qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit, with the rest qualifying for half that amount. Vehicles losing credits include those from BMW, Hyundai, Nissan, Rivian , Volkswagen and Volvo Cars. Some vehicles from those brands may still qualify for the credits if they are assembled in the U.S. and if certain components are sourced domestically. The new rules apply to vehicles delivered to consumers starting Tuesday. Tax incentives for EVs are designed to lower the costs for consumers, who have cited the high prices as a main barrier to going electric. The average new EV in the U.S. costs about $58,600, or almost $10,000 more than the average new vehicle.\n\nA BMW iX3 electric SUV is on display during 2020 Beijing International Automotive Exhibition (Auto China 2020) at China International Exhibition Center on September 26, 2020 in Beijing, China. Visual China Group | Getty Images\n\nThe new incentives are part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the landmark climate law that President Joe Biden signed in August. The bill set various manufacturing requirements for new all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles to qualify for the $7,500 tax credit. The law also established limits on sales prices and excluded consumers who earn more than $150,000 a year and couples who earn more than $300,000. White House officials hope the updated list will incentivize automakers to move their supply chains from China to the U.S. while promoting climate-friendly EVs. China currently makes most EV batteries worldwide. Under the new rules, electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles can receive the full tax credit only if the vehicles are made in North America and the batteries and critical minerals are from the U.S. or a country with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement.\n\nAt least 40% of the critical minerals by value in the vehicle's batteries must have been extracted, processed or recycled in the U.S. or countries with which it has trade deals. That percentage will increase by 10% each year until it reaches 80% after 2026. Additionally, at least 50% of the value of the components in an EV's battery must be manufactured or assembled in North America. That percentage will increase to 60% in 2024 and 2025 and will increase by 10% each year until it hits 90% in 2028. The new rules may undercut the Biden administration's proposed tailpipe emissions limits, which could require as many as 67% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2032 to be all-electric — the country's most ambitious climate regulation yet. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gases in the country, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Despite a rise in EV sales in the U.S. in recent years, they accounted for only 5.8% of all the 13.8 million new vehicles sold last year, according to data from the Kelley Blue Book. The U.S. is the world's third-largest market for EVs behind China and Europe. — John Rosevear contributed to this report.",

                    "snippet": "Australian drivers are expected to see more electric cars race into the country after the federal government pledged to introduce a policy forcing automakers to launch more of their greenest vehicles locally.\n\nA new fuel-efficiency standard will place a limit on pollution from petrol and diesel vehicles and will encourage the import of more zero and low-emission cars that the government estimates could save motorists $519 in annual fuel costs.\n\nA draft of the policy is expected by the end of the year, following consultation with industry and community groups.\n\nEnergy Minister Chris Bowen and Transport Minister Catherine King announced the commitment on Wednesday as part of the government's response to the National Electric Vehicle Strategy, which attracted more than 500 submissions last year.\n\nMr Bowen said Australia's lack of a fuel-efficiency standard meant fewer electric cars had been launched in Australia and, on average, cars in the country used 40 per cent more fuel than in Europe, 20 per cent more than in the US, and 15 per cent more than cars in New Zealand.\n\nThe Albanese Government will draft a new fuel-efficiency standard to limit pollution from petrol and diesel vehicles by the end of this year (pictured, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese)\n\n'This strategy delivers on our commitment to provide greater choice for Australians to drive cars that are cleaner and cheaper to run,' Mr Bowen said.\n\n'Fuel-efficiency standards are an important step forward for our country.'\n\nThe limit on carbon emissions from vehicles will apply only to new vehicles, and will not affect cars already on Australian roads.\n\nAustralia is one of just four wealthy nations without a fuel-efficiency standard in place, alongside Russia, Turkey and Indonesia.\n\nMs King said introducing the policy in Australia would help the local car market catch up to progress in the rest of the world.\n\n'It will send a strong message to the global car industry that when it comes to transport technology, Australia will no longer settle for less,' Ms King said.\n\n'More than 85 per cent of all cars sold in the world are subject to fuel-efficiency standards. It's time Australians were offered the same choice.'\n\nElectric vehicles made up 3.8 per cent of all new car sales in Australia in 2022, compared to 23 per cent of car sales in Europe and 29 per cent in China, according to research firm Canalys.\n\nGreenpeace Australia senior campaigner Lindsay Soutar said the group welcomed the government's commitment to a fuel-efficiency standard but warned it would need to 'resist pressure from car makers' when setting the policy's emissions limit.\n\nThe upcoming pollution limit will likely increase the sale of electric (above) and low-emission vehicles in Australia\n\n'From here, the task will be to implement strong standards in line with major markets like New Zealand and the (European Union), and avoid dodgy loopholes and credits that weaken the integrity of the scheme,' she said.\n\n'The government needs to deliver for Australian households and the climate, not big car makers.'\n\nTony Weber, chief executive of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries that represents 68 car brands, said the group supported the introduction of a fuel-efficiency standard for 'light vehicles'.\n\n'Australia needs an ambitious yet achievable fuel-efficiency standard in order for car makers to compete for the limited amount of zero and low emission products that are currently available in the global marketplace,' he said.",

The initiative will help cut the country's emissions by at least 3 million tonnes of carbon by 2030, and over 10 million tonnes by 2035, Bowen said.\n\nThe Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) welcomed the move but said Australia must bring in strong standards or \"remain the world’s dumping ground for dated, high-emission vehicles,\" chief executive Behyad Jafari said.\n\nOn average, new cars in Australia use 40% more fuel than the European Union and 20% more than the United States, with studies showing the introduction of a fuel efficiency standard could save motorists A$519 ($349) per year, Bowen said.\n\nGreens party leader Adam Bandt said the government's strategy needs to accelerate and needs electric vehicle targets as well as the fuel efficiency standards.\n\nCHARGING DEBATE\n\nDemand for electric vehicles is growing in Australia, although supply has not kept up with demand in the absence of incentives for automakers.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nAustralia's centre-left Labor government last year flagged plans to introduce new regulations to increase sales of electric cars.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese, who won power last year on a promise of climate policy reforms, cut taxes for electric vehicles and raised Australia's 2030 target for cutting carbon emissions to a 43% reduction from 2005 levels.\n\nThe initiatives came after about a decade of inaction under the previous Liberal government, which set Australia behind all its peers.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in 2019 that policies to reduce vehicle emissions would \"end the weekend\", while other critics said it would be a death knell for popular utility vehicles, or utes, used by builders and farmers.\n\nBowen acknowledged more needs to be done on infrastructure to charge EV cars.\n\nThere are about 83,000 EVs on Australian roads and as at December 2022, there were just over 4,900 public chargers located at fewer than 2,400 sites.\n\n\"We're way behind the rest of the world again,\" Bowen said in a radio interview later in the day.\n\n\"We are fixing that. We've got a policy of putting in a fast charger once every 150 kilometres on the highway. I'll be saying more about that pretty soon,\" he said.\n\n($1 = 1.4868 Australian dollars)\n\nReporting by Renju Jose in Sydney; Editing by Lincoln Feast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                    "snippet": "Los Angeles County officials revealed their $43-billion recommended budget for the upcoming fiscal year this week — a spending blueprint they promised would keep the region’s social safety net intact even as the county prepares to pay a steep price for how poorly officials have historically handled the jails and juvenile halls.\n\nAt a Tuesday Board of Supervisors meeting, Chief Executive Officer Fesia Davenport warned that the county may have to spend as much as $3 billion resolving claims of sexual abuse at its facilities.\n\n“Beyond the traumatic personal impact on the survivors of abuse, these cases could have a profound impact on the county budget for decades to come,” Davenport said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a letter accompanying the budget, she said the claims presented one of the “most serious fiscal challenges in recent history.”\n\nAt $43 billion, the county has one of the largest budgets in local government, bigger than many states and triple that of the city of Los Angeles. It’s just a little more than what experts estimate it will cost to repair all the bridges in the U.S. It’s just a little less than what the U.S. gave to Ukraine in military aid in the first year or so of the war. It’s about what Elon Musk offered for Twitter.\n\nThe Board of Supervisors weighed in Tuesday on the spending plan. The budget, if approved by the board in its current form this summer, would funnel hundreds of millions toward services that aim to get people off the streets and out of jail.\n\nThe plan puts $692 million toward homeless services , most of it coming from money generated through Measure H, a voter-approved sales tax to fund homeless programs. And $288 million would go toward “alternatives to incarceration.”\n\n“I believe this budget sets the county on the right foot for the next fiscal year to keep ourselves accountable to our public for the job we were all elected to do and again strengthens that safety net that we know the county is responsible for,” said Board Chair Janice Hahn.\n\nDavenport told the board the budget was put together in the face of a “mixed” economic forecast and warned the county may have to tighten purse strings down the road — in part to cover the recent deluge of claims of sexual abuse at county facilities.\n\nTo resolve an estimated 3,000 sexual abuse claims, the county’s lawyers predict it could be forced to spend anywhere between $1.6 billion and $3 billion. That’s more than the county plans to spend next year on its probation, fire, and parks and recreation departments — combined.\n\nMatt McGloin, a top budget official with the county’s Chief Executive Office, told reporters the lawsuits would have an effect “unprecedented in scope.”\n\nThe flood of claims stem from a state law that granted victims of childhood sexual assault additional time to file lawsuits. Like many California institutions with checkered histories, the county has been flooded with lawsuits, many from plaintiffs who were once at the now-infamous MacLaren Children’s Center, where physical and sexual abuse ran rampant .\n\nDavenport told reporters the county was still figuring out where the money to pay victims would come from.\n\n“Everything has to be on the table,” said Davenport, adding they’d consider cutting department budgets or dipping into the county’s rainy day fund.\n\nThe financial repercussions from past crises arrive as the county faces a new wave of problems in its jails and juvenile halls. Ten people have died in county jails this year — a death toll advocates attribute in part to overcrowding in decrepit facilities. Meanwhile, conditions in the juvenile halls have become so deplorable that state regulators are mulling shutting them down.\n\nMore than 50 members of the probation workers’ union showed up at the board meeting Tuesday morning. Dwight Thompson, a vice president with the Deputy Probation Officers’ Union, said members were there to implore the board to fix working conditions within the facilities and bargain “in good faith” in contract negotiations.\n\nThe supervisors then went into closed session, which spokespeople said was to discuss the probation department. The decision left a strange vacuum inside the chamber for the better part of two hours; one man stayed in the board room yelling profanities and singing while probation department members milled outside.\n\nAccording to budget documents, the county is anticipating an “overhaul” of the county’s probation system, which could require funding for “additional investments in staff, programs, and facilities.”\n\nSuch investments are not detailed in the recommended budget for probation, and funding for the department is roughly unchanged from the year before. According to budget officials within the CEO’s office, the total recommended probation budget is $1.059 billion — a $956,000 decrease from the year before.\n\nThe recommended budget for the sheriff’s department rose to $3.99 billion, an increase of about $136 million, according to the budget officials. The budget dedicates $6.6 million to fund the new Office of Constitutional Policing, which Sheriff Robert Luna created to fix conditions in the jails and eradicate deputy “gangs.” County leaders said an additional roughly $50 million would go to improve “unacceptable conditions” in the jails.\n\nThe funding drew a strong rebuke from progressive advocates, who argued the county was not following through on its promise to reorient the county’s programs away from jail.\n\n“It’s not actually reflective of what the community has been calling for,” said Megan Castillo, the policy and advocacy manager at La Defensa, a group pushing for prison alternatives. “It’s a status quo budget. It’s a budget that we’ve seen time and time again where law enforcement receives increases in funding.”\n\nCounty officials maintained they were following through on their promises to move away from incarceration, pointing to $288 million going to programs and projects that aim to keep people away from jail, such as job training, housing, and reentry and mental health services.\n\nThat portion of the spending plan was borne out of Measure J, a since-overturned ballot measure aimed at criminal justice reform that county voters approved in 2020 in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis.\n\nThe measure required the county to set aside 10% of its “locally generated unrestricted revenues” — money the county controls directly, such as property and sales tax, that isn’t already earmarked for another purpose — on programs that kept people out of jail.\n\nThough a judge ultimately ruled the measure unconstitutional , county leaders promised to follow in the spirit of what voters demanded and funnel one-tenth of these flexible dollars toward jail alternatives.\n\nBamby Salcedo, head of the TransLatin@ Coalition who helped pass the measure, said she had originally expected closer to a billion dollars funneled to these programs by this fiscal year. With $288 million dedicated this year, she said she felt the board was “shortchanging” the community.\n\nDavenport told the board she believes the county has fulfilled its pledge.\n\n“While some advocates remain dissatisfied, moving from zero to more than half a billion dollars in funding in the space of three years is unprecedented for just about any county initiative,” she said.\n\n",

The former federal official had faced up to five years in prison and/or a $10,000 fine.\n\nBrinton had been deputy assistant secretary of the Energy Department’s office of spent fuel and waste disposition but was fired when an arrest warrant was issued in a similar theft in Nevada.\n\nBefore being let go, the Energy Department had hailed Brinton as a barrier breaker because of the nonbinary identification.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Brinton removed a tag from the luggage of a fellow passenger on an American Airlines flight from Washington to Minneapolis.\n\nThe airline confirmed that Brinton, who was seen on the airport’s surveillance footage claiming luggage, actually didn’t check in any bags. The victim also identified the baggage Brinton was carrying as hers.\n\nThe hearing Monday came a week after Brinton pleaded “no contest” to a similar theft at the Las Vegas airport. Brinton got a suspended sentence of 180 days in prison and ordered to pay $3,670 to that victim.\n\nAccording to Las Vegas authorities, Brinton was spotted on the baggage claim area’s surveillance cameras taking a $320 woman’s Away-brand bag that contained more than $3,500 worth of jewelry, clothing and cosmetics.\n\nThe victim and Brinton had flown on the same United flight from Washington Dulles International Airport.\n\nBrinton, who does not identify as either male or female, was described in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s arrest warrant, as “a white male adult wearing a white T-shirt with a large rainbow-colored atomic nuclear symbol design.”\n\nA third luggage-theft charge has been made against Brinton.\n\nTanzanian fashion designer Asya Khamsin has claimed that Brinton wore certain custom-made outfits for a Vanity Fair photoshoot that she had stolen from her in 2018 at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n\nShe saw those images on TV in a news report about Brinton’s other luggage-theft cases.\n\n“I saw the images. Those were my custom designs, which were lost in that bag in 2018,” Ms. Khamsin told Fox News Digital in an interview. “He wore my clothes, which [were] stolen.”\n\n• Matt Delaney contributed to this report.\n\n• Victor Morton can be reached at vmorton@washingtontimes.com.",

                    "snippet": "Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News will pay $788m (£634m) to settle a blockbuster lawsuit that threatened to expose the inner workings of the organisation as it claimed the US presidential election was rigged.\n\nDominion Voting Systems launched a high-profile legal battle against Fox over accusations the network knowingly broadcast false claims that its technology was used to rig the 2020 election of Joe Biden. It was seeking damages of $1.6bn.\n\nBut a dramatic settlement was announced last night after a jury had been sworn in and with the two sides poised to give opening statements.\n\nReturning to the packed courtroom after an unexplained delay, Eric Davis, Delaware Superior Court Judge, said: “The parties have resolved their case.”\n\nJustin Nelson, a lawyer for Dominion, said the case was settled for $787.5m. He added: “The truth matters, lies have consequences.”\n\nIn a statement last night, Fox News said: “We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems.\n\n“We acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This statement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.\n\n“We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nThe last-gasp deal spares Fox News from a potentially embarrassing trial that would have shed light on the heart of Mr Murdoch’s empire.\n\nThe 92-year-old was expected to take the stand, while Fox News chairman Suzanne Scott and presenters including Tucker Carlson were also set to testify.\n\nIn a further potential blow to Fox’s reputation, Judge Davis appointed special master John Elzufon to examine whether the channel complied with its obligations to disclose key evidence ahead of the trial, following complaints from Dominion’s lawyers.\n\nDominion had accused Fox of knowingly airing false claims that its products were used to rig votes in the 2020 US presidential election in favour of Joe Biden.\n\nFox argued that claims of vote rigging, propagated by Mr Trump and his lawyers, were inherently newsworthy and protected by legal doctrines concerning press freedom.\n\nThe trial, which would have been one of the biggest US defamation cases in decades, was about to begin on Tuesday after the judge ordered a one-day delay as the two sides tried to thrash out a settlement.\n\nLawyers representing the two sides selected 12 jurors and 12 alternates from a pool of 58 potential jurors, paving the way for opening arguments.\n\nFox had been preparing to use clips of Homer Simpson voting in presidential elections as part of its defence.\n\nThe company had included four scenes from the long-running animated sitcom among more than 5,000 exhibits submitted to the court.\n\nThey included an episode in which Homer attempts to cast a vote for Democrat President Barack Obama and another in which he votes for former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nA short film from 2016 depicts Russian President Vladimir Putin disguised as an American voter trying to convince Homer to vote for Donald Trump, while in a more recent clip Homer is unsure whether to vote for Putin or Trump.\n\nIt was not clear how Fox planned to use the clips in its defence. The Simpsons has aired on the Fox network since 1989, though the series was acquired by Disney as part of its 2019 takeover of Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.\n\nAlso among Fox’s exhibits was material from the 2020 HBO documentary Kill Chain: The Cyber War on America’s Elections, which examines the vulnerability of US voting systems to interference by hostile states.\n\nMeanwhile, Dominion submitted more than 7,000 exhibits to the court, including videos and transcripts from Fox shows alongside emails and text messages exchanged between Mr Murdoch and other senior executives.\n\nCourt documents revealed earlier this year that some of Fox News’s stars and executives did not wholly believe the allegations that the election was stolen from Mr Trump, but continued to air them as they were concerned about losing viewers.\n\nJudge Davis ruled in March that the statements aired on Fox were false.\n\nHowever, the settlement does not mark the end of Fox’s legal woes, as the channel is facing a separate $2.7bn lawsuit filed by Smartmatic, another voting technology company.\n\nErik Connolly, a lawyer for Smartmatic, said: “Dominion’s litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox’s disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest.\n\n“Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy.”\n\nReuters reported that Staple Street Capital Group LLC, the small buyout firm that owns Dominion Voting Systems, has scored what is a $787.5m windfall.\n\nThe amount is equivalent to 20 times the $38.3m the New York-based private equity firm paid in 2018 to acquire a 76.2% stake in Dominion. Staple Street has $900m in assets under management, according to its website.\n\nDominion and Staple Street representatives did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on how much Dominion stands to receive after legal expenses and taxes.",

                    "snippet": "Photo: Jean Catuffe/GC Images\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nAs a rule, it is generally not a great idea for lawyers to antagonize the presiding judge in the days leading up to a major trial. So Fox News’ lawyers could not have been feeling particularly good last week when, during the homestretch of pretrial hearings in the defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems, Delaware judge Eric M. Davis told them that they had a “credibility problem.” This is how a judge tells lawyers that he does not trust them, and for a party to high-profile litigation, the credibility of the lawyers in the courtroom is an essential asset — hard to acquire, closely guarded, and easily lost — that can subtly but crucially affect the proceedings.\n\nThis was an undoubtedly dramatic last-minute turn of events, but Fox has been on the ropes for weeks now in the run-up to the Tuesday start of the trial, which finds the network in a conspicuously weak position as it begins its defense against Dominion in what is expected to be a roughly six-week-long proceeding. The trial was supposed to begin Monday, but on Sunday evening the judge delayed the start of the case amid reports of a last minute push by Fox to settle. The election-technology company is looking for $1.6 billion in damages as a result of 20 episodes of alleged defamation that largely occurred during a monthlong period from mid-November to mid-December 2020 during segments in which crank lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell claimed that Dominion was part of an elaborate — and entirely fictional — conspiracy to steal the 2020 presidential election from Donald Trump. The segments mostly aired on shows hosted by Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, and Jeanine Pirro, on both Fox News and Fox Business.\n\nOf course, no one knows how the case is going to turn out, but watching it with a lawyer’s eye means being aware of the key signals that have already been sent — what do the judge’s comments and pretrial rulings suggest? — as well as which courtroom dynamics to study closely as the case progresses. Here are the most important things to know and watch as the Fox-Dominion trial unfolds:\n\n1.\n\nThe trial begins Tuesday, but after two years of litigation, Fox News’ lawyers had revealed for the first time in the case that Rupert Murdoch, the chair of parent company Fox Corporation, also officially holds a position at Fox News as “executive chair.” This may seem like a small and perhaps inconsequential point — Fox News’ lawyers called the title an “honorific” — but it is not. The reason is that Fox’s lawyers have fought hard throughout the litigation to insist there is a clear distinction — both legally and factually in their day-to-day operations — between Fox News and Fox Corporation. Both are defendants in the case, but Fox Corporation has deeper pockets and a large portfolio of media properties in addition to the network. As it happens, though, Murdoch himself provides an even more direct and formal link between the governance of the parent and the subsidiary than we all previously knew.\n\nJudge Davis, a former corporate litigator himself, was understandably angry with Fox’s lawyers, who, like their adversaries working on behalf of Dominion, will be spending the weeks ahead in trial asking the judge to make countless evidentiary and procedural rulings in their favor — about what evidence the jurors should be allowed to hear, what sorts of arguments the lawyers can make in front of them, and what legal instructions will guide their final decision. “My problem,” Davis reportedly said after learning about Murdoch’s dual role, “is that it has been represented to me more than once that he is not an officer” at Fox News. Things managed to get worse the next day, when Davis announced that he would appoint an outside lawyer to determine whether Fox had tried to mislead Dominion and the court; he left open the possibility that he would tell the jury that Fox had tried to withhold unhelpful information during the case. “I need people to tell me the truth,” he told Fox’s lawyers, which is not exactly an encouraging sign of things to come when the case is nominally about whether the media outlet is populated and run by a bunch of liars.\n\n2.\n\nIn recent months, the lawsuit generated an avalanche of news coverage after the parties filed lengthy motions for “summary judgment,” in which they each asked Davis to rule in their favor based on what they claimed were undisputed facts gathered in the course of discovery. Dominion’s papers included a trove of internal communications that seemed to show many Fox executives and on-air personalities casting doubt on the false claims about Dominion in real time, but many of those communications also raised eyebrows among media and political observers thanks to a bunch of juicy tidbits that had less to do with Dominion’s actual case than the apparent internal dysfunction and more broadly endemic dishonesty among major figures at the network.\n\nDavis ruled on the competing motions a couple weeks ago, and the result for Fox was truly abysmal. Dominion largely ran the table — at least as much as reasonably could have been expected under the circumstances — and the ruling substantially narrowed the scope of the trial and, more to the point, what Dominion needs to establish in the coming weeks in order to prevail.\n\nDavis concluded, for instance, that all of the statements at issue about Dominion — the suggestions that the company had an algorithm that allowed it to change votes, for instance, or that it had been founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chávez — were, in fact, indisputably false. In yet another ominous sign, he underscored the point in italicized, all-caps, and bold text: “The evidence developed in this civil proceeding,” he wrote, “demonstrates that [it] is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements [at issue] relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.”\n\nThe judge also ruled that Fox News in particular had “published” the statements through its broadcasts, but at the time he did not know about Murdoch’s formal role at the network. He concluded that the jury would need to resolve whether Fox Corporation itself had played a role in broadcasting the statements, particularly given evidence presented by Dominion indicating that Murdoch and his son Lachlan, who is the CEO of Fox Corporation, had weighed in on the network’s editorial direction during the relevant period.\n\nFox Corporation’s exposure on this point remains outstanding for trial, but Davis implied last week that he might have ruled differently in the course of the case if he had known that Murdoch also held a title as an officer of Fox News in addition to Fox Corporation.\n\n3.\n\nMost notably, the judge blew right through a series of claims by Fox that its broadcasts might be protected by an assortment of legal privileges that have been recognized to varying degrees in prior defamation cases — privileges that were widely seen as among Fox’s best lines of legal defense. Davis rejected the availability of a “neutral report privilege,” which permits media organizations to report on “newsworthy” allegations even if they are false, by concluding that Fox News had failed to “conduct good-faith, disinterested reporting” on the false claims. He precluded a defense under the “fair report privilege,” which allows media outlets to report on claims made by third parties in the course of official legal proceedings, because none of the statements at issue actually concerned a pending legal case. (Most of the statements had in fact been made before any of the many failed lawsuits filed on behalf of Trump.) And he held that Fox was not entitled to protection from a “privilege for opinion” since all of the allegedly defamatory statements were statements of fact, either in part or in whole.\n\n4.\n\nThat leaves just two discrete — but difficult — elements of the case for Dominion to establish in the weeks ahead.\n\nFirst, did either or both companies act with “actual malice”? This will require Dominion to show by clear and convincing evidence that the people responsible for broadcasting the statements either knew that they were false or acted with “reckless disregard” as to the falsity of the claims.\n\nIn approaching this question to date, Dominion has tended toward a scattershot approach. It has lumped together corporate officers and editorial employees with varying levels of authority and control across Fox News and Fox Corporation, often treating their roles and responsibilities interchangeably. It has excerpted snippets of deposition testimony and documents that sound bad in isolation while presenting little if any surrounding context — a necessary accommodation, perhaps, to the constraints of legal writing but one that will be unavailable at trial. And it has generally elided exactly who knew what and when in relation to the exact timing of the relevant broadcasts and their specific substance.\n\nUnder Supreme Court precedent, however, actual malice must be “brought home” to the people with responsibility for the allegedly defamatory publication. In other words, the plaintiff needs to identify the specific people responsible for publication of the relevant statements and establish that one or more of those people acted with actual malice. As a result, it is safe to assume that Fox’s lawyers will try to hold Dominion’s lawyers to a much more rigorous analytic framework — with a more precise focus on exactly who was doing what at specific points of time in relation to the relevant broadcasts, their specific content, and the nature of the relevant employees’ and officers’ editorial roles. Whether the jury will care remains to be seen, but this will also be about building a potential record for appeal in the event that Fox suffers a significant loss at trial.\n\n5.\n\nThe second major outstanding question at this trial is whether Dominion is entitled to some meaningful amount of financial damages — both in the way of compensatory damages for economic harm that the company suffered as well as potential punitive damages. Dominion is seeking nearly $1 billion for “the ultimate destruction of its enterprise value,” but the public information provided by Dominion in support of its extraordinary damages claim has been modest, and as Davis noted in his ruling, the issue is both hotly disputed and “intensely factual.” Fox has argued, for instance, that it is “simply unrealistic that a company that was generating as little as $10.6 million in annual EBITDA before the 2020 election could have skyrocketed to $1 billion in enterprise value in the few short years that followed.”\n\nOn this point in particular, we can expect a so-called “battle of the experts,” in which each side offers very different versions of what actually happened to Dominion’s financial condition as a result of Fox’s broadcasts. Both Dominion and Fox have prepared experts on damages and the related question of causation — whether and to what extent any economic harm to Dominion can be traced to Fox’s alleged misconduct (as opposed to other factors like, say, Trump’s crazy tweets). It is not clear whether all of the designated experts would testify at trial, but whoever takes the stand will be among the most important witnesses in the case, even though they will not have the boldface names that have attracted media attention in recent months. The lawyers will have invested considerable time both to preparing their own experts and to constructing lines of cross-examination for the other side’s experts on the most minute points with literally hundreds of millions of dollars at stake.\n\n6.\n\nThere are several important courtroom dynamics worth keeping an eye on in the days and weeks ahead that will give the smart observer a sense of where things are headed. The most obvious is what the parties choose to highlight and develop in their opening statements. Now that the case has been considerably narrowed, the lawyers should be able to provide tighter and clearer road maps to the evidence that they now believe is most pertinent to what is left of the case. It will be the first time we see the lawyers engage at length on the newly refashioned legal terrain for the case.\n\nThe idea of a trial theme may seem hazy, but lawyers devote immense effort to constructing master narratives in the hopes that they will guide the jury through the ins and outs of the case. Dominion has had a clear through-line throughout the proceeding: that many of Fox’s executives, on-air personalities, and editorial staff defamed Dominion in order to indulge their right-wing audience and boost their bottom line and that they did so to the considerable detriment of the country’s democratic process.\n\nUntil recently, Fox had leaned heavily on the idea that it was simply engaged in a form of traditional (and protected) news-gathering in the course of a complex and high-profile national issue. But now that the judge has gutted much of that defense, it will be interesting to see what, if anything, Fox’s lawyers come up with to replace it. The opening statement should be a good early answer to this key question: Have Fox’s lawyers developed a competing theme in the network’s defense?\n\nFox’s lawyers also have to be worried about the judge’s frustration with them in recent weeks, and it is far from clear that the pain is over. If more new evidence emerges at trial that Fox should have disclosed, the judge is not likely to go easy on them.\n\nAnd, of course, the results of the inquiry into the belated disclosure of Murdoch’s dual status at Fox News and Fox Corporation remain outstanding with the possibility that more problematic revelations could surface that may both further anger the judge and lead him to tell the jury about it. That alone could be very bad for Fox: The underlying issue concerns the most prominent and important person in the corporate hierarchy, it reeks of the sort of legal gamesmanship that jurors can easily understand, and it also happens to be entirely consistent with Dominion’s theory of its case — that the network and its executives think they can do whatever they want with little to no regard for relevant legal and ethical constraints or, for that matter, the well-being of our country.\n\nA trial will test both the accuracy and the limits of that broader proposition in a setting that Fox’s executives, hosts, and staff do not control. It is no doubt a deeply uncomfortable position for a media outlet that is used to telling other people what to believe. This time, a jury would get the last word.",

                    "snippet": "Davis prohibited Fox from arguing that the network was merely reporting on allegations made by Donald Trump and his lawyers, which Fox contended were newsworthy whether or not they were true. So the case would turn not on whether Fox had aired defamatory falsehoods, which Davis determined it had, but on whether, in airing defamatory falsehoods, Fox had displayed “actual malice” — essentially, reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nThe evidence for such reckless disregard brought to light by Dominion’s lawyers during the discovery phase of the case was already overwhelming, and the trial promised more to come. A filing that Fox’s lawyers made last week demonstrated their predicament. In it, the attorneys laid out some of the points they planned to make in their opening argument, asking for “guidance from the court to ensure that it can make its opening statement without undue interruption and delay.” Those points looked a lot like an attempt by Fox to use a legal backdoor to smuggle in arguments that the judge had already forbidden.\n\n“To defend this case, Fox witnesses must be able to testify about the reasons why Fox covered the allegations on the air,” said the filing. “Fox witnesses will all testify that they covered the Dominion-related allegations because the allegations were part of the most newsworthy story of the day.” This, even though Davis had specifically ruled that this argument was invalid because, among other things, “the evidence does not support” the contention that Fox “conducted good-faith, disinterested reporting.”\n\nIn order to defend Fox from a finding of actual malice, its lawyers seemed set on bringing Fox’s alternative reality into the courtroom, acting as if taking Trump and his attorneys at their word was a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Testimony and documentary evidence, Fox’s lawyers said in the filing, “will show that the president and the lawyers bringing the election fraud lawsuits continuously told Fox that they had evidence to support their claims and that they would be presenting that evidence to courts.” That, in turn, explains why the Fox hosts “did not know that the president’s allegations were false or harbor serious doubts about the truth of the allegations.”\n\nIn other words, they can’t be blamed for treating the president of the United States as a reliable source.",

You blame me for interfering with your democracy but I don’t have to. You are doing it to yourselves,\" says the voice attributed to Putin in the clip. \"Polling stations are closing. You don’t know who to trust. You are divided. There are strings we can pull. But we don’t have to. You are pulling them for us.\"\n\nThe clip was shared April 16 on Instagram and shows a split screen with a man watching and the text \"Listen here!\" appearing at the top. The video features what appears to be Putin speaking in an eastern European accent and standing at a lectern featuring the Russian coat of arms.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)\n\nBut this isn’t a genuine video of the Russian president. It’s a deepfake — a form of artificial intelligence that manipulates people’s likenesses and makes it look as if they are doing or saying something that they didn’t. The technology behind deepfakes, and other manipulated imagery, is starting to advance faster than the tools used to identify the tricks.\n\nPutin releasing a public address in English aimed at the American people would be worldwide news. We couldn’t find any news reports about it.\n\nBut we did find where the clip originated.\n\nThe video was created in September 2020 as part of an advertisement campaign by an organization called \"RepresentUs,\" which describes itself as a nonpartisan, anti-corruption organization \"fighting to fix broken and ineffective government.\"\n\nThe campaign, called \"Save the Vote,\" included the fake video of Putin and another artificial intelligence-generated clip of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that makes similar statements about division in the U.S.\n\nIn a Sept. 29, 2020, press release, the organization said it was launching the \"first ever use of deepfake technology in a major ad campaign\" to illustrate that \"democracy will collapse\" unless Americans take \"immediate action to fix political corruption, voter suppression gerrymandering, and our broken election systems.\"\n\nThe two dictator videos were set to air following the first presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. But the videos were \"so bold\" that the clips were \"pulled at the last minute\" by Fox News, CNN and MSNBC, RepresentUs said.\n\nInstead, the organization posted the Putin deepfake on its YouTube channel that day. At the end of the clip, text on the screen says: \"This footage is not real, but the threat is. Join us.\"\n\nBut that context is missing in the version shared on Instagram.\n\nOn Oct. 2, 2020, Fortune published a story about the dictator deepfakes going viral. The article detailed how RepresentUs asked New York-based advertising agency, Mischief USA, to create the campaign.\n\nKevin Mulroy, the agency’s executive creative director, told Fortune that his team was trying to find a way to grab people’s attention and make them care about the prospect of democracy falling apart.\n\n\"That’s when we started thinking about deepfakes,\" Mulroy says. \"The point of the deepfake is to get this message through in such a noisy area.\"\n\nOn April 18, RepresentUs CEO Joshua Graham told PolitiFact, \"As we make clear in our video, it’s fake – and that’s exactly the point. By featuring two authoritarians who want to see our country fail, our goal was to wake Americans up to the fact that our democracy faces serious threats. Most importantly, as is the case with all of our videos, we want to inspire Americans of all political stripes to protect our democratic republic.\"\n\nWe rate the claim that this video shows Russian President Vladimir Putin talking in English about U.S. democracy False.",

Your thoughts on that?\n\nBRIAN STELTER: There's been this very interesting debate about what the rules, where the standards should be. How easy or how hard should it be to sue a media company, to sue a newsroom for defamation? The Supreme Court 60 years ago set that bar very high, which is why you almost never see it happen. You almost never see a case almost get to trial the way this did.\n\nHowever, some Republicans want to loosen those laws, make it easier to sue news outlets. And yet, I think if that were to happen, outlets like Fox, which are much more hyper-partisan, which engage much more in opinion and much less in gathering the news, they would be very vulnerable if that bar were to be lowered, it became easier to sue a network like Fox, or an outlet like Yahoo, or a newspaper like \"New York Times,\" for defamation.",

                    "snippet": "George McAndrews never forgot how his father, a chiropractor, was brought to tears by the scorn and ridicule lobbed on him and others in the field by medical doctors.\n\n“We as children felt it, we knew he was being ridiculed,” recalled Mr. McAndrews’ brother, Tom, of their upbringing in an Iowa town along the Mississippi River. “Medical doctors would tell their patients, ‘Don’t go near chiropractors, they’re quacks.’ And we’d hear that at school from our friends.”\n\nYears later, as an attorney practicing law in Chicago, Mr. McAndrews went to war with a group that was, at the time, a major purveyor of chiropractic skepticism: the American Medical Association.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, he took on the case of Chicago chiropractor Chester Wilk, who sued the AMA for conspiring to destroy the profession by labeling it an “unscientific cult” and telling members that any association with chiropractors was unethical.\n\n“It meant chiropractors couldn’t work at a hospital, couldn’t get a referral from a doctor, couldn’t get on insurance plans — it just really marginalized the profession,” said Paul Slater, who served as Mr. McAndrews’ co-counsel on the case.\n\nSlater still marvels at the moment their small legal team — four attorneys and a paralegal — first walked into court and realized the scope of their David vs. Goliath battle.\n\n“The other side probably had 100 attorneys and I turned to George and said, ‘Oh, my God! How are we going to keep up?’ And George, he just smiled at me and said, ‘Paul, we’re going to surround them and attack from all sides at once.’”\n\nAfter a yearslong battle that involved two trials and appeals that reached the U.S. Supreme Court — which declined to take on the case three times — Mr. McAndrews prevailed.\n\nThe AMA was forced by a federal judge to do something previously unthinkable: publish a full-page statement in its own medical journal acknowledging that it had unlawfully tried to eliminate chiropractors from plying their trade, and that its rules on avoiding chiropractors were unlawful.\n\nMr. McAndrews died April 7 after months of living with Alzheimer’s disease. He was 87.\n\nThe case was a turning point for chiropractors, who began to gain wider acceptance.\n\nWilk, the chiropractor whom Mr. McAndrews represented, died last year. An obituary the Sun-Times ran about his life included a statement from the AMA that read: “The current collaborative relationship between the AMA and chiropractic profession is far removed from the history of 60 or 70 years ago and has long reflected that physicians and chiropractors work side-by-side as members of the patient care team.”\n\nDr. Chester Wilk, seen here in 1992, was one of four chiropractors whose lawsuit led to a ruling that the American Medical Association tried to destroy a competitor. Sun-Times file\n\nFormer Chicago Sun-Times reporter Howard Wolinsky wrote a book on the case, “Contain and Eliminate: The American Medical Association’s Conspiracy to Destroy Chiropractic.”\n\nTop law firms wanted nothing to do with taking on the AMA in an antitrust suit, Wolinksy said.\n\nMr. McAndrews’ legal experience was mostly as a patent attorney. But he was motivated to take on the legal challenge.\n\nHis late brother, Jerome McAndrews, a chiropractor, said if he didn’t stand up for the chiropractic profession, that their late father would “crawl out of the grave and haunt him,” Wolinsky said.\n\nSome law partners at Mr. McAndrews’ firm opposed him taking the case and gave him pushback by withholding bonuses and secretarial support, said Wolinsky, who extensively interviewed Mr. McAndrews. “He explained that some of his partners had children who were medical doctors.”\n\nTo keep costs down, Mr. McAndrews slept in his car and ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches while on the road taking depositions, Wolinsky said.\n\nMr. McAndrews was used to taking on larger opponents.\n\nHe helped lead his small Catholic high school to the state basketball championship in Iowa as an undersized 6-foot-3 center.\n\n“He was ferocious on the boards against guys who were much taller,” said his brother, Tom.\n\nMr. McAndrews attended the University of Notre Dame but took a two-year break in undergraduate studies to serve in the Navy. He was stationed on the command ship of an armada assigned to test the hydrogen bomb on remote islands in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nHe later returned and earned mechanical engineering and law degrees from Notre Dame.\n\n“In my opinion, it was the greatest one-man show I ever saw in a legal case, and I’m 78 and have seen a lot of cases,” Slater said. “Everybody pitched in, but George McAndrews was the general, a force of nature. And he was a unique character and as nice a person as I’ve ever met.”\n\nMr. McAndrews is survived by his wife, Kathy; his sons, Matthew, Peter and Paul; daughters Melissa and Mary; as well as 21 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.\n\nServices have been held.\n\n",

                    "snippet": "OPINION:\n\nSergei Lavrov, Russia’s suave minister of foreign affairs, was recently asked by one of Russia’s ubiquitous billionaires: Whom does President Vladimir Putin seek advice from on the Ukraine war?\n\nHe responded that Mr. Putin has only three advisers, though they are renowned. They are Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great and Catherine the Great. By the way, how did Russia amass so many extraordinarily wealthy people from the Marxist-Leninist state of the old Soviet Union? My friend Taki Theodoracopulos, the international playboy and famed rastaquouere, tells me that very rich Russians apparently outnumber even the very rich Arabs in the posh recreational spots of Europe. This development began at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Were opportunistic Russians hiding their loot under their beds before the fall? How else did they acquire it?\n\nYet back to the Russian minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Lavrov. He said that Mr. Putin has only three advisers: Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great and Catherine the Great, who may have been great. Still, Catherine was also — if memory serves — considerably overweight. If she were around today, she would be a candidate for one of those relentless weight-reduction ads that blanket Fox News in the evening when I am trying to find out about happenings in Ukraine.\n\nAll three of Mr. Putin’s advisers, of course, have been dead for many years, though even the corpulent czarina, were she still alive today, would do a better job of pacifying Ukraine than the hapless Mr. Putin. If he really is advised by three corpses, I suggest he get more lively and alert advisers. Henry Kissinger recently counseled both sides in the war that the time is ripe to seek a diplomatic settlement. I am with Henry.\n\nWhen I heard of the famously facetious Mr. Lavrov’s humorous remark, I wondered whom our president has chosen to advise him. From President Biden’s performance in office, I would expect him to admit that he has been advised by the three stooges. Albeit his stooges would not be the three of yesteryear’s Hollywood, Larry, Moe and Shemp. They, too, are deceased. More likely, he has been advised by Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.\n\nOf course, there is a fourth stooge whom Joe counsels with. That would be his son Hunter Biden. The elder Biden is on record as having said that Hunter is the “smartest guy” he knows, though admittedly, Hunter cannot even keep track of the whereabouts of his computer, the one with incriminating evidence on it. In Mr. Biden’s world, smart people lose things. Even he loses things — for instance, 100 or so classified documents.\n\nMr. Biden probably presides over the least distinguished Cabinet in history. There is Ms. Harris, who, as vice president, has had to shuffle and reshuffle her staff so many times that Washington insiders suspect that COVID-19 is alive and well in her office. Why can she not keep staff members for more than a few weeks? There is Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas, who has appeared before congressional committees so often that he might well be suspected of being a subversive or a foreign agent. He was, after all, born in Cuba, was he not? And, of course, there is Transportation Secretary Buttigieg, who, like all of these three modern-day stooges, has a dreadful time getting down to our southern border to see how things are going. Frankly, I sympathize with the secretary. What if he got kidnapped down there? What if the White House refused to pay his ransom?\n\nWhy cannot Mr. Biden put together a Cabinet of some distinction? Well, a Cabinet of distinction would be difficult to put together for either party as things stand right now. There is a troubling problem facing both political parties. America is lacking in leadership. A few paragraphs ago, I mentioned Henry Kissinger. He is a man of stature. Now in his 99th year, he is still writing, thinking and listening. But he is too old to lead. Maybe he could advise the leaders of at least one party, and that would be the Republicans. The Democrats already take their leadership from something called “woke.” As in “we done woke up.”\n\nGlory to Ukraine!\n\n• R.

Trusting in God.\"\n\nCameras weren't allowed inside at the 2nd District Court of Appeals in Fort Worth.\n\nThe case returned here after the Criminal Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled last year that the original judge who convicted Mason and sentenced her to five years in prison and this appellate court which upheld her conviction, made a mistake.\n\nThat's because the Criminal Court of Appeals found the lower courts failed to require proof that Mason had actual knowledge it was a crime for her to vote during the 2016 election.\n\nAt the time, Mason was on supervised release after serving a sentence in federal prison for tax fraud.\n\nHer provisional ballot didn't count because she was ineligible to vote.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office told the three-judge panel that Mason understood the consequences because she testified in 2018 that had she known it was illegal to vote, she wouldn't have done so.\n\nBut Mason's attorney, Sophia Lakin of the ACLU Texas, said Mason didn't know this when she voted two years earlier.\n\nLakin spoke with reporters after the hearing. \"She testified that yes, in 2018, of course she knew at that point in time that the state considered her ineligible to vote and that is what she testified to in 2018. This says nothing about what she knew when she submitted her provisional ballot in 2016.\"\n\nReverend Frederick Haynes is Mason's Pastor. He said, \"We stand with her; we believe in her. Crystal has said to me, pastor, why would I jeopardize time away from my family? Crystal has said that to me repeatedly.\"\n\nThe Tarrant County District Attorney's Office declined comment on the case.\n\nNo word when the 2nd District Court of Appeals will rule.\n\nMason and her supporters hope the court will overturn her conviction.\n\nBarbara Arnwine, President of the Transformative Justice Coalition told reporters, \"Yes, I think that would be the most meaningful decision this court could make for the people of Texas.\"\n\nAs for Mason, she said she remains committed to clearing her name. \"Been a very long battle, six years. Six years of not knowing whether I'm going back to prison.\"\n\nIn a news release later in the day, Mason announced she has established a non-profit organization to help educate people about their rights called Crystal Mason - The Fight Against Voter Suppression.\n\nAs previously reported, Mason's case has been mentioned at the Texas Capitol as the House and Senate debate whether to increase the penalty for illegal voting back to a felony after lawmakers reduced it in 2021 to a Class A misdemeanor.\n\nThe Senate's version of the bill, which passed last month, would also eliminate a provision, also approved by the legislature in 2021, that a person who is ineligible to vote has to have actual knowledge that casting a ballot would be illegal.\n\nThe House version keeps intent as part of the law.\n\nIf the House passes the legislation, both chambers would have to hash out a compromise.",

                    "snippet": "OPINION:\n\nSAO PAULO, BRAZIL — “Asia Firster” is the term applied to those who argue that the threat Beijing poses to Taiwan should be Washington’s top national security priority.\n\nI think Asia Firsters are right about that but wrong to jump to the conclusion that Americans must resign themselves to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin crushing Ukraine and Iranian dictator Ali Khamenei becoming the hegemon of the Middle East. As for other corners of the world, they mostly ignore them.\n\nBy now, we should have learned that when America retreats, America’s enemies advance — as Mr. Putin did after President Biden surrendered to the Taliban in 2021, as Mr. Khamenei and the terrorist founders of the Islamic State did after then-President Barack Obama pulled out of Iraq in 2011.\n\nIf Mr. Putin succeeds in using the force of arms to alter the European balance of power — I hope you’re not so naive as to suppose he’d be satisfied with Ukraine alone — expect Mr. Khamenei to double down on his attempt to dominate the Middle East. At that point, how likely is it that Chinese President Xi Jinping would regard American resolve and power as credible deterrents to his plans for Asia?\n\nA broader strategic point: Mr. Xi’s doctrine may be Asia First, but it’s not Asia Only. The leader of the most powerful Communist Party in history has global ambitions.\n\n“There are changes — the likes of which we haven’t seen for 100 years — and we are driving these changes together,” Mr. Xi told Mr. Putin on his visit to the Kremlin last month.\n\nReplied Mr. Putin: “I agree.”\n\nIn the Middle East, Mr. Xi has brokered a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Riyadh also recently approved partial membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a Beijing-led political and security bloc that includes Russia and India.\n\nIn Africa, China is a major economic power with a People’s Liberation Army base in Djibouti.\n\nIn Canada, there have been allegations of Chinese interference in recent elections. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau seems — I’ll phrase this diplomatically — insufficiently troubled.\n\nAnd here in Sao Paulo, as I’m tapping away on my laptop, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is paying a visit to China. “Partido Comunista Chines Chama Lula de ‘Grande Amigo’” is the chyron I’m seeing on a television news channel: “The Chinese Communist Party calls Lula ‘a great friend.’” Among the reasons: He has endorsed terminating the U.S. dollar’s dominance in international trade.\n\nBrazil has been drifting away from the U.S. and toward China for years. The same is true of many other South American nations.\n\nChina is South America’s top trading partner and a major source of foreign investment and lending. According to Gen. Laura J. Richardson, commander of U.S. Southern Command, China is also “conducting gray zone activities to expand its military and political access and influence.” The CCP is alleged to routinely meddle in elections to achieve the outcomes it seeks — with even less scrutiny than in Canada.\n\nChinese diplomats are not staunch opponents of corruption, especially if such means achieve their ends. They never admonish local leaders over human rights, carbon emissions, and other matters not central to the CCP’s interests.\n\nShould we simply say to our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere: “Goodbye and good luck! We’re a clumsy giant, currently obsessed with gender, race, and saving the planet, so what can we do?”\n\nIn fact, U.S. policy has long been heading in this direction.\n\nFor example, 10 years ago, John Kerry, then secretary of state, helped open the doors of Latin America to China’s rulers — and any other interested parties — by announcing, at a meeting of the Organization of American States, that the “era of the Monroe Doctrine is over.”\n\nA kernel of history: In 1823, President James Madison warned the powerful European empires of the day that the U.S. would oppose further colonization of the Western Hemisphere and regard as provocative the installation of proxies to rule “our southern brethren.” He added that it was the “true policy of the United States to leave the parties to themselves.”\n\nI can’t imagine a clearer statement of anti-imperialism. Why would Mr. Kerry cancel it? Perhaps because he embraces the fashionable leftist view of the U.S. as a nation that may not — as empires had in the past — plant flags, take territory, and seize resources but does, nevertheless, seek to advance its own interests and values. How dare we!\n\nLast year, Mr. Biden went further, demanding the resignation of Mauricio Claver-Carone, the first-ever American president of the 64-year-old Inter-American Development Bank. Mr. Claver-Carone saw his primary mission as boosting U.S. influence in the region and limiting the increasing dominance of the Chinese Communist Party within the bank. Why would Mr. Biden cancel that? Your guess is as good as mine.\n\nElsewhere in the region, Cuba — despite Mr. Obama’s eager attempt at rapprochement — remains unfree and hostile to the U.S., with leverage over the Venezuelan and Nicaraguan regimes, which, by the way, have become amigos with Iran’s rulers.\n\nAnd in February, President Lula, disregarding U.S. disapproval, permitted two Iranian warships to dock in Rio de Janeiro for an unprecedented one-week stay.\n\nDoes it matter if Brazil and its neighbors pivot away from the U.S. and toward an expanding geopolitical ecosystem that includes Tehran and Moscow, with Beijing as the apex predator?\n\nAmericans can decide that it doesn’t, that only Taiwan is of serious concern, or that, unlike China, we’re incapable of tackling more than one national security challenge at a time. But it would be wise for us to think hard about what that choice will mean for America’s future, not to mention that of the wider world.\n\n• Clifford D.

Bils is one of the administrators for several social media accounts that fly under the moniker “Donbass Devushka” (which translates to “Donbas Girl”). Donbas is a region in Ukraine where most of the recent fighting has been focused.\n\nThe description on the Donbass Devushka Telegram account reads,\n\n“Russian-style information warfare.” All efforts to consolidate all your geopolitical news into one channel. Bringing the multipolar world together.”\n\nHow did our United States counterintelligence and military miss this? Too focused on climate change and pronouns is my guess.\n\n🚨BREAKING – INVESTIGATION: Classified docs leaked by Jack Teixeira gained attention after being shared by pro-Russian \"Donbass Devushka\" account, allegedly run by former US Navy officer Sarah Bils who is now under investigation. The documents went viral, prompting Pentagon… pic.twitter.com/2R55EiS947 — Simon Ateba (@simonateba) April 17, 2023\n\nFrom The Wall Street Journal:\n\nA social-media account overseen by a former U.S. Navy noncommissioned officer—a prominent online voice supporting Russia’s war on Ukraine—played a key role in the spread of intelligence documents allegedly leaked by Airman First Class Jack Teixeira. A purported Russian blogger known as Donbass Devushka, which translates as Donbas Girl, reposted the files from obscure online chat rooms. The blog is the face of a network of pro-Kremlin social-media, podcasting, merchandise and fundraising accounts. But the person who hosted podcasts as Donbass Devushka and oversees these accounts is a Washington-state-based former U.S. enlisted aviation electronics technician whose real name is Sarah Bils. Russia first intervened in the Donbas part of eastern Ukraine in 2014, and most of the recent fighting has focused on that area. Ms. Bils, 37 years old, served at the U.S. naval air station on Whidbey Island until late last year, even as the accounts she had established and supervised glorified the Russian military and the paramilitary Wagner Group. They are among the most widely followed English-language social-media outlets promoting Russia’s views.\n\nApparently, Bils and her cohorts run a podcast (linked below) and several social media sites on YouTube, Rumble, Locals, Spotify, Twitter, and Telegram. It appears that Bils and Co. have been incredibly prolific and one would think the FBI would have had them on their radar some time ago.\n\nThose pro-lifers and parents at school board meetings, though.\n\nThis is serious. While the legacy media and lawmakers like Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) are still chasing down Trump and Russia collusion while pouring money into Ukraine to defeat Russia, a Russian apologist was embedded in our U.S. military openly spreading propaganda. According to USNI News, a publication of the U.S. Naval Institute, Bils enlisted in the Navy in 2009, completed “A” school at the Naval Aviation Technical Training Center in Pensacola Florida, and attended the Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit in Lemoore, California before reporting to the Fleet Readiness Center Northwest on Whidbey Island, Washington in 2011. Bils performed different roles at the air station until her discharge on November 27, 2022, just a bit over nine months after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nCuriouser and curiouser.\n\nThe Donbass Devushka Twitter account has over 68,000 followers, and the Telegram account has over 72,000 subscribers. Not sure if this has been a recent development, but the tweets on the Twitter account are now protected. One would think that this would have given someone at the FBI pause before the site shared the documents leaked by Teixeira.\n\nOne would think…\n\nIn an interview Saturday at her home in Oak Harbor, Wash., Ms. Bils said she is an administrator of the Donbass Devushka persona, and acknowledged raising funds and hosting podcasts under that name. She added, however, that she is one of 15 people “all over the world” involved in running the Donbass Devushka network. Ms. Bils declined to identify these people.\n\nBils runs a tighter ship than Generals Mark Milley and Lloyd Austin. They should bring her back on board as a consultant.\n\nOn April 5, the Donbass Devushka Telegram account posted four of the allegedly leaked classified documents to its 65,000 followers, according to a screenshot seen by The Wall Street Journal. That led several large Russian social-media accounts to pick up on the documents, after which the Pentagon launched an investigation. Ms. Bils says another administrator posted the four files.\n\nUSNI News reported that The Department of Justice “declined to comment.” The Wall Street Journal also reports that the Navy also will not comment.\n\nThere is no evidence that Ms. Bils, who had a security clearance during her Navy service, has used that access to steal any classified information herself. “I obviously know the gravity of top-secret classified materials. We didn’t leak them,” she said. Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, a spokesman for the Pentagon, referred requests for comment on Ms. Bils and her role in reposting classified information to the Justice Department, which declined to comment. In a statement in response to questions, Gen. Ryder said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered a review of intelligence access, accountability and control procedures within the Pentagon to help prevent future leaks.\n\nSo, it seems a circular firing squad could be developing.\n\nThe opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.",

                    "snippet": "That a National Guardsman not long out of high school had a top-secret security clearance and access to documents meant for Pentagon leaders has raised questions in and outside government about whether the security clearance process works and whether too many people can see the nation’s biggest secrets.\n\nFederal authorities arrested Jack Teixeira, 21, on Thursday in connection with the investigation into classified documents that were leaked on the internet. Records show that Teixeira, an airman first class with the Massachusetts Air National Guard, has been in uniform since September 2019 and was stationed at the Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod. He was employed as a cyber transport systems journeyman — essentially an information technology specialist — which allowed him to obtain top-secret clearance for his work.\n\nJack Teixeira. via Facebook\n\nWhile he helped maintain the Defense Department’s IT infrastructure, some question why a low-level airman had expansive access to classified documents that he allegedly shared with a close-knit online community of fellow gamers.\n\nJohn Brennan, who served as CIA director during the Obama administration, said every department and agency should regularly review the necessity for individuals to maintain security clearances. People should only have access to information “they need to do their job,” he said.\n\n“These reviews should also validate the accesses individuals have to networks, databases and specific classified enclaves of information. Just because someone has a top-secret code-word clearance doesn’t mean that they should have access to all information on the top-secret network,” he added. “There needs to be ‘role-based’ access.”\n\nMore than 1.25 million people currently have top-secret clearance, according to the latest declassified Director of National Intelligence report on security clearance determinations. That count, as of October 2019, constitutes a 3% increase from the previous year and includes government employees, contractors and other unnamed people. New estimates from current government officials put this year's figure at closer to 1.3 million people.\n\nGovernmentwide, there were more than 144,000 initial top-secret security clearance reviews during the 2022 financial year and more than 99,000 periodic reinvestigations, which occur every five years regardless of a person’s actions, according to a January government report on security clearance reform. The rate at which reviews are performed has increased during the Biden administration, the report said, as the Trump administration struggled with performing security clearances.\n\n“That’s a lot of people with clearances,” Amy Zegart, the author of “Spies, Lies, and Algorithms: The History and Future of American Intelligence,” said of the 1.3 million figure. “There’s clearly some challenges with following what everyone is doing, what they’re doing online, and I think we’re facing a moment in time when we have both overclassification of information and underprotection of classified information. So, in some ways, it’s the worst of both worlds.”\n\nRaising further concerns about security clearances, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that a U.S. Navy noncommissioned officer, Sarah Bils, who left the service in November, hosted a podcast and helped maintain an online persona known as Donbass Devushka that supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and allegedly shared a handful of the leaked documents.\n\nBils had a security clearance and maintained the channel while in active service, military officials said. The channels allegedly shared Pentagon documents that were doctored to aid the Russian narrative, but Bils denied sharing information while in uniform or changing information on the documents.\n\n“I obviously know the gravity of top-secret classified materials. We didn’t leak them,” she told the Journal.\n\nAfter the Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden leaks, the government expanded the checks it put on people with security clearances. The use of flash drives and other means of moving data were also banned and, after years of discussions, agencies have rolled out what they’ve called “continuous monitoring” or “continuous vetting” to periodically check financial and criminal records in search of behavior that could make someone a security risk. That new check process has nearly quadrupled the number of actionable alerts during the last financial year, according to the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency.\n\nJack Teixeira is taken into custody by armed tactical agents April 13, in Dighton, Mass. WCVB-TV via AP\n\nBut Teixeira reportedly used Discord, an online forum originally used as a chat platform by video game enthusiasts, to share the leaked information with his small community of online friends, and he took photos of paper documents that he may have smuggled out of a secure facility. Bils used Telegram, an online messaging platform, to share the pro-Russian content.\n\nSecurity checks are only permitted to examine a person’s public-facing social media presence — not private chatrooms, emails, messages or other accounts such as Discord or Telegram.\n\nWilliam Evanina, who served as the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center during the Obama and Trump administrations, said that it is a challenge to stop someone from “bringing documents out of a building and taking them home.” But he said it is possible the Pentagon could expand monitoring of government-owned computers, similar to how the intelligence community tracks keystrokes when users are on classified systems.\n\nIt may not have stopped Teixeira, however.\n\n“At the end of the day, if you take documents out of the CIA, NSA or here the National Guard, you bring them home and you photograph them, there’s not much anybody can do about that, except try and get that individual before they make that bad decision,” Evanina said.\n\nA Senate Intelligence Committee aide told NBC News that Congress would be reviewing the clearance system after the recent leaks and the committee would be holding hearings on the topic, though they were not particularly concerned with the number of people who were given top-secret security clearances. The aide noted that Teixeira was only one bad actor among the 1.3 million.\n\nWhile the committee will likely discuss whether clearances should include nonpublicly available social media accounts and communications, the aide said, there are concerns whether there is the bandwidth to pursue such a thorough scrub and if it could have a chilling effect on the intelligence community’s recruitment, as it sacrifices employees’ privacy further.\n\nOn Tuesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s memo directed that there be an immediate review of how how classified info is handled and secured.\n\nIt directs several Pentagon leaders to review procedures and standards and to provide an interim report to the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security by May 2.\n\nThe memo also outlines extensive requirements that are already expected to be followed, some of which were likely violated in the recent leak, including validating the “need to know” standard when individuals request classified content, and calling on leaders to lead by example and reinforce the importance of safeguarding classified info.\n\nNBC News reported last week that the White House is considering changing this policy and prioritizing national security over personal privacy online, but it appears that it would be a heavy lift and may require an act of Congress.\n\n“The security-privacy challenge has existed forever,” Brennan said, “but the advent of the internet, social media and the overall explosion of the digital domain have compounded the challenge exponentially.”",

                    "snippet": "BOSTON (AP) — A Massachusetts Air National Guardsman charged with leaking highly classified military documents is due back in court on Wednesday for a hearing to decide whether he should remain behind bars while he awaits trial.\n\nJack Teixeira, 21, was arrested by heavily armed tactical agents at his Massachusetts home last week and charged, under the Espionage Act, with unauthorized retention and transmission of classified national defense information. During his first court appearance in Boston's federal court Friday, a magistrate judge ordered him to remain in custody until Wednesday's detention hearing.\n\nTeixeira is accused of sharing highly classified military documents about the Ukraine war and other top national security issues in a chat room on Discord, a social media platform that started as a hangout for gamers. The stunning breach exposing closely held intelligence has sparked international uproar and raised fresh questions about America’s ability to safeguard its secrets.\n\nAir Force leaders said Tuesday that they were investigating how a lone airman could access and distribute possibly hundreds of highly classified documents. The Air Force has also taken away the intelligence mission from the Air National Guard 102nd Intelligence Wing based in Cape Cod — where Teixeira served — pending further review.\n\nCourt records unsealed last week revealed how billing records the FBI obtained from Discord and interviews with social media comrades led authorities to Teixeira.\n\nPolitical Cartoons View All 949 Images\n\nInvestigators believe he was the leader of an online private chat group on Discord called Thug Shaker Central, which drew roughly two dozen enthusiasts who talked about their favorite types of guns and shared memes and jokes, some of them racist. The group also held a running discussion on wars that included talk of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA Discord user familiar with Teixeira’s online posts told the FBI that a username linked to Teixeira began posting what appeared to be classified information roughly in December. The person provided the FBI with basic identifying information about Teixeira, including that he called himself “Jack,” claimed to be part of the Air National Guard and appeared to live in Massachusetts, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe person also told the FBI that Teixeira switched from typing out documents in his possession to taking them home and photographing them because he “had become concerned that he may be discovered making the transcriptions of text in the workplace.”\n\nThat’s different from what posters have told The Associated Press and other media outlets, saying the user they would call “the O.G.” started posting images of documents because he was annoyed other users weren’t taking him seriously.\n\nThe affidavit alleges Teixeira was detected on April 6 – the day The New York Times first published a story about the breach of documents – searching for the word “leak” in a classified system. The FBI says that was reason to believe Teixeira was trying to find information about the investigation into who was responsible for the leaks.\n\nThe classified documents range from briefing slides mapping out Ukrainian military positions to assessments of international support for Ukraine and other sensitive topics, including under what circumstances Russian President Vladimir Putin might use nuclear weapons.\n\nAuthorities have not revealed an alleged motive. But members of the Discord group described Teixeira as someone looking to show off, rather than being motivated by a desire to inform the public about U.S. military operations or to influence American policy.\n\nThe Biden administration has scrambled to contain the potential diplomatic and military fallout from the leaks since they were first reported, moving to reassure allies and assess the scope of damage. There has been no clear answer on how many documents were leaked. The Associated Press has viewed approximately 50 documents; some estimates put the total number in the hundreds.",

                    "snippet": "Jack Teixeira, the 21-year-old Massachusetts air national guard member who was charged on Friday with leaking classified Pentagon documents, has joined a long list of individuals who have been prosecuted for allegedly disclosing sensitive US national security intelligence.\n\nPrevious leaks have ranged from information about US wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan to details of Russian interference in American elections. Despite the diversity of the subject matter, the treatment of the leakers has shared a common relentlessness on the part of the US government in pursuing those it accuses of breaching its trust.\n\nDaniel Ellsberg\n\nDaniel Ellsberg in 2004. Photograph: Stephen Hird/REUTERS\n\nIn March 1971, Ellsberg, a military analyst, leaked a top-secret study to the New York Times. The document, which became known as the Pentagon Papers, spanned US involvement in Vietnam between 1945 and 1967 and exposed covert efforts by successive US presidents to escalate the conflict while hiding deep doubts about the chances of victory.\n\nEllsberg was prosecuted under the 1917 Espionage Act – a law designed to catch first world war spies – and faced a maximum sentence of 115 years in prison. All charges were dropped after the FBI’s illegal wiretapping of Ellsberg was revealed.\n\nEarly last month, the 92-year-old Ellsberg, who has become revered as the doyen of whistleblowers, revealed that he has terminal cancer and has months to live.\n\nJeffrey Sterling\n\nSterling, a former CIA operations officer, served more than two years of a 42-month sentence after he was prosecuted under the Espionage Act for allegedly leaking information about a botched covert US operation with Iran to the then New York Times journalist James Risen. In 2003, Risen published details of the operation in a book, State of War.\n\nIt was not until 2011, under Barack Obama’s administration, that Sterling was arrested. Federal prosecutors accused him of leaking details of the Iran engagement out of “anger and resentment” – a reference to an earlier claim from Sterling, who is Black, that he suffered discrimination while at the CIA.\n\nSterling has denied ever talking to Risen about Iran.\n\nThomas Drake\n\nThomas Drake in 2014. Photograph: Ilya S Savenok/Getty Images for the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival\n\nA former senior official with the National Security Agency (NSA), Drake was charged in 2010 with leaking classified information to the Baltimore Sun. He faced 10 counts with a possible 35-year sentence, though the charges were whittled down to a single misdemeanor for which he was given a year of probation.\n\nDrake has always insisted that he had no intention of harming national security, presenting himself as a whistleblower who had been trying to sound the alarm on technical flaws in NSA programs that were wasting billions of dollars.\n\nChelsea Manning\n\nChelsea Manning. Photograph: Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs a former intelligence analyst posted outside Baghdad during the Iraq war, Manning had access to classified information that shone a light on the vagaries of war there and in Afghanistan. She leaked hundreds of thousands of military records and diplomatic cables via the open information site WikiLeaks in 2010 in one of the largest disclosures of military secrets in US history.\n\nThree years later, she was convicted under the Espionage Act. She was given a 35-year sentence, of which she served seven. In a memoir published last year, README.txt, she wrote: “What I did during my enlistment was an act of rebellion, of resistance, and of civic disobedience.”\n\nJohn Kiriakou\n\nKiriakou, a former CIA counter-terrorism officer, was sentenced to two years in prison in 2012 for leaking the identity of a covert operative to a journalist. He was the first CIA officer to be imprisoned for doing so.\n\nProsecutors insisted that they went after Kiriakou to protect the safety of undercover government agents. He countered that he was a whistleblower attempting to expose the use of torture in the so-called “war on terror”.\n\nKiriakou was the first former government official to talk in public about waterboarding, the form of controlled drowning used against terrorism suspects in the aftermath of 9/11.\n\nEdward Snowden\n\nEdward Snowden. Illustration: Joseph Pierce/The Guardian\n\nIn 2013 Snowden disclosed inside intelligence about the US government’s dragnet surveillance of the digital communications of millions of Americans through the Guardian and Washington Post. Working at the time as an NSA contractor, he fled to Hong Kong and from there to Russia, where he was granted asylum.\n\nAfter he outed himself through the Guardian, a raft of Republican politicians demanded that Snowden be extradited back to the US to face trial as a traitor. Donald Trump called for his execution three years before he was elected US president.\n\nIn his support, a number of prominent public figures, including Ellsberg, have lauded Snowden as a pro-democracy hero who should be allowed to come home with a pardon.\n\nReality Winner\n\nReality Winner in 2010 while in the Air Force. Photograph: undefined/US Government\n\nThe former NSA intelligence contractor and air force linguist was sentenced to more than five years under the Espionage Act in 2018 for leaking a top-secret document on Russian interference in the US presidential election. She pleaded guilty to having handed a copy of a classified report about Russian hacking of voting software suppliers in the 2016 race.\n\nShe was released after three years. Having regained her freedom she told CBS: “I am not a traitor, I am not a spy. I am somebody who only acted out of love for what this country stands for.”\n\nJulian Assange\n\nThe WikiLeaks founder was initially charged in 2019 with conspiring to hack into a military computer – an accusation arising out of the massive leak by Manning to WikiLeaks nine years earlier. The seriousness of prosecutors’ case against him was dramatically expanded later that year to include 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act.\n\nAssange has been held for the past four years in Belmarsh prison in London as extradition proceedings work their way through British courts. The Joe Biden White House has come under mounting pressure to drop the charges, including from leading news outlets, on grounds that the prosecution is putting a chill on press freedom.\n\nJack Teixeira\n\nThe air national guardsman now finds his name added to the list. He was charged in a Boston federal court on Friday with two counts under the Espionage Act, each carrying a possible 10-year sentence.\n\nProsecutors allege that they have evidence to prove that Teixeira unlawfully retained and transmitted hundreds of classified defence documents. The FBI has indicated that he enjoyed security clearance for sensitive intelligence marked “top secret/sensitive compartmented information”.\n\nThe leak of the Pentagon documents is believed to have started on the social media platform Discord. Teixeira reportedly visited the platform over several years posting about guns, online games and racist memes, though any motive for the alleged leak remains obscure.",

                    "snippet": "Members of the state’s congressional delegation are calling for more information and accountability from military leaders after federal prosecutors charged a 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guardsman with leaking highly classified government documents on a social media platform for gamers.\n\nCongressmen Jake Auchincloss and Seth Moulton said officials at the Air National Guard and Pentagon need to provide answers as to how a low-level airman could have facilitated a security breach like the one investigators accuse Airman Jack Teixeira of inducing. The calls come as top Air Force officials are starting to hone in on Teixeira’s National Guard unit at Joint Base Cape Cod.\n\nMoulton, who served in the Marine Corps and is a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said when someone is in the military, as with any organization, there has to be accountability for alleged wrongdoing.\n\n“My job description as a Marine platoon commander was very simple: you are responsible for everything your platoon does or fails to do. And so we also do have to look at this airman’s chain of command and see if there’s anything that they missed,” Moulton said in an interview. “... The Massachusetts National Guard should fully take responsibility for the fact that this happened under their watch.”\n\nRead more: FBI agent says Jack Teixeira could have more classified documents at North Dighton residences\n\nAuchincloss, a Marine Corps veteran, said if Teixeira is found guilty of leaking classified documents, he “should be punished for that.”\n\nThe Pentagon, and potentially the Air National Guard, should have a procedure and policy conversation about “why it is that a junior enlisted Air National Guardsmen can print out Ukrainian war plans being briefed to the Joint Staff,” Auchincloss said.\n\n“We in Massachusetts are very proud of our National Guard and remain very proud of our National Guard, but they, along with the Pentagon, do have to answer and be accountable for security breaches on their watch,” Auchincloss said in an interview.\n\nMassachusetts National Guard spokesman Don Veitch said national security is their “foremost priority, and any attempt to undermine it compromises our values and degrades trust among our members, the public, allies and partners.”\n\n“We are fully cooperating with the FBI’s investigation into the alleged actions of Jack Teixeira. Should this investigation or any subsequent inspections identify issues with procedures in handling classified information, we will not hesitate to take appropriate measures,” Veitch said in a statement to MassLive.\n\nVeitch declined to comment on specific aspects of the investigation and referred questions to the Department of Justice and FBI. A spokesperson for the FBI’s Boston Bureau declined to comment.\n\nTop U.S. Air Force officials are also starting to focus their attention on an Air National Guard intelligence unit based out of Cape Cod.\n\nAir Force Secretary Frank Kendall said Tuesday that he directed the Air Force inspector general to look at Teixeira’s unit and “anything associated with this leak that could have gone wrong.” And in the meantime, the Air Force took away the intelligence mission from the unit where the leaks occurred.\n\nFBI investigators accused Teixeira in court documents of at first posting transcripts of sensitive information to a Discord server in December 2022 before uploading photos of documents containing U.S. classification markings to the social media platform in January 2023.\n\nMassachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, right, appears in U.S. District Court in Boston, Friday, April 14, 2023.

(Margaret Small via AP)AP\n\nProsecutors have charged him with unauthorized retention and transmission of national defense information and unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material in connection to the leak of one document accessed in February 2023 describing the status of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Teixeira faces up to 15 years in prison.\n\nA judge ordered Teixeira to remain in federal custody pending a detention hearing scheduled for Wednesday morning in a Boston federal courtroom.\n\nA public defender appointed to represent Teixeira did not immediately respond to an inquiry.\n\nThe FBI believes Teixeira may have more documents in two residences in Dighton, according to a 20-page application for a search warrant filed last week in federal court.\n\nFBI Special Agent Victoria Horne asked a judge last week for permission to search residences on Maple and Walker streets because “there is reason to believe that additional classified information is currently being stored in an unsecure manner.”\n\nThe leak of the documents — which, outside of the war in Ukraine, also describe U.S. intelligence-gathering efforts in allied countries like South Korea — may have long-term impacts on the United States’ ability to collect information because they can expose sources, methods and budgets, Moulton said.\n\nOne of the worst outcomes, Moulton said, is a U.S. spy in Russia or China getting killed because their identity is exposed through the leaked documents. The documents may also have on-the-ground effects in Ukraine, he said.\n\n“Frankly, I am so shocked that we’re talking about a 15-year prison sentence here because he has risked, I mean, this will cost lives,” Moulton said. “It’s impossible to imagine that more Ukrainians won’t die because of this leak, and yet, we’re just talking about a 15-year prison sentence for this kid.”\n\nAuchincloss also pointed to potential impacts the leak could have on a Ukrainian counteroffensive reportedly planned for this spring or summer.\n\n“The United States, if anything, needs to use these leaks as a call to action to double down on our support in terms of arms, money and intelligence to our Ukrainian allies,” he said.\n\nTeixeira worked at the Air National Guard as a cyber defense operations journeyman at the Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts. He is an airman first class and enlisted in the National Guard in September 2019, according to court documents.\n\nHe served in the 102nd Intelligence Wing of the Air National Guard, which says its mission is to “provide worldwide precision intelligence and command and control along with trained and experienced airmen for expeditionary combat support and homeland security.”\n\nCourt documents said Teixeira had a top-secret security clearance and “sensitive compartmented access” to other highly classified programs, both of which he received in 2021.\n\nU.S. Rep. Richard Neal said the work of the Massachusetts Air National Guard “should not be diminished because of the reckless actions of one individual.”\n\n“They work tirelessly to support and defend us here in the Commonwealth and throughout the country,” he said in a statement to MassLive. “That said, every service member takes an oath of loyalty to the Constitution, and the leak of classified documents is an affront to our democratic institutions. I fully anticipate that our legal system will bring this individual to justice.”\n\nMaterials from the Associated Press were used in this report.",

He is expected back in court for a hearing Wednesday.\n\nThe leaks have raised questions as to how a single airman could have removed so many documents without being detected, why there were not safety checks in place and how the documents could have lingered online undetected for months.\n\n“How could this guardsman take this information and distribute it electronically for weeks, if not months, and nobody knew about it?” Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana asked the Air Force leaders testifying before a Senate defense appropriations subcommittee.\n\nThese are questions the Air Force is asking, too. For top secret information across the military, there’s supposed to be accountable control officers who are responsible for recording active top secret documents and ensuring they have been either properly secured or disposed of, such as through a shredder or by burning them.\n\nPending further review, “The 102nd Intelligence Wing is not currently performing its assigned intelligence mission. The mission has been temporarily reassigned to other organizations within the Air Force,” the service said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nIn addition, the Air Force is conducting a service-wide review of how each command handles classified information, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown told members of subcommittee.\n\nThe Air Force’s own reviews are on top of a military-wide review directed on Monday by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Austin has ordered that all military facilities that handle classified information report to him within 45 days on how they access, share, store and destroy the nation’s secrets following the leaks.\n\nRead more: FBI agent says Jack Teixeira could have more classified documents at North Dighton residences\n\nThe leaked documents exposed to the world unvarnished secret assessments on the war in Ukraine, the capabilities and geopolitical interests of other nations and other national security issues.\n\nTeixeira posted the highly classified material in a geopolitical chat room on Discord, a social media platform that started as a hangout for gamers.\n\n“He had access to some aspects based on his job as a cyber administrator. He took advantage of that access,” Brown said.",

Matt Gaetz held up a copy of secret Pentagon slides leaked in an online gamer chat room.\n\nIn an exchange during an unclassified committee hearing on national security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, Mr. Gaetz, Florida Republican, pressed Defense Department brass to assess whether China had surpassed the U.S. in hypersonic weapons technology.\n\nJedidiah P. Royal, the principal deputy assistant secretary for Indo-Pacific security, recommended taking up that discussion behind closed doors in a classified setting.\n\n“It’s sort of been unclassified without our consent,” Mr. Gaetz responded, holding up a copy of a leaked presentation containing a classified assessment of China’s missile capabilities.\n\nMr. Gaetz said the classified assessment aligned with public warnings from the head of the Indo-Pacific Command that the Chinese advances in hypersonic missiles — which may be capable of evading U.S. missile defenses — pose a serious threat to U.S. interests in the region.\n\n“You have been giving us the accurate information,” he told Adm. John Aquilino, the Command’s chief.\n\nBut “the truth is we have not made a sufficient investment in hypersonic defense in order to ensure that we have a credible deterrent threat,” Mr. Gaetz said. “How do our littoral combat ships ever get into a fight in a China-Taiwan scenario?”\n\nAdm. Aquilino said that discussion is also better suited for a classified setting.\n\nThe exchange prompted Rep.

He is accused in the leak of highly classified military documents as prosecutors unsealed charges and revealed how billing records and interviews with social media comrades helped pinpoint Teixeira. (Margaret Small via AP)\n\nBOSTON (AP) — A Massachusetts Air National Guardsman charged with leaking highly classified military documents is due back in court on Wednesday for a hearing to decide whether he should remain behind bars while he awaits trial.\n\nJack Teixeira , 21, was arrested by heavily armed tactical agents at his Massachusetts home last week and charged, under the Espionage Act, with unauthorized retention and transmission of classified national defense information. During his first court appearance in Boston’s federal court Friday, a magistrate judge ordered him to remain in custody until Wednesday’s detention hearing.\n\nTeixeira is accused of sharing highly classified military documents about the Ukraine war and other top national security issues in a chat room on Discord, a social media platform that started as a hangout for gamers. The stunning breach exposing closely held intelligence has sparked international uproar and raised fresh questions about America’s ability to safeguard its secrets.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAir Force leaders said Tuesday that they were investigating how a lone airman could access and distribute possibly hundreds of highly classified documents. The Air Force has also taken away the intelligence mission from the Air National Guard 102nd Intelligence Wing based in Cape Cod — where Teixeira served — pending further review.\n\nCourt records unsealed last week revealed how billing records the FBI obtained from Discord and interviews with social media comrades led authorities to Teixeira.\n\nInvestigators believe he was the leader of an online private chat group on Discord called Thug Shaker Central, which drew roughly two dozen enthusiasts who talked about their favorite types of guns and shared memes and jokes, some of them racist. The group also held a running discussion on wars that included talk of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA Discord user familiar with Teixeira’s online posts told the FBI that a username linked to Teixeira began posting what appeared to be classified information roughly in December. The person provided the FBI with basic identifying information about Teixeira, including that he called himself “Jack,” claimed to be part of the Air National Guard and appeared to live in Massachusetts, according to the affidavit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe person also told the FBI that Teixeira switched from typing out documents in his possession to taking them home and photographing them because he “had become concerned that he may be discovered making the transcriptions of text in the workplace.”\n\nThat’s different from what posters have told The Associated Press and other media outlets, saying the user they would call “the O.G.” started posting images of documents because he was annoyed other users weren’t taking him seriously.\n\nThe affidavit alleges Teixeira was detected on April 6 – the day The New York Times first published a story about the breach of documents – searching for the word “leak” in a classified system. The FBI says that was reason to believe Teixeira was trying to find information about the investigation into who was responsible for the leaks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe classified documents range from briefing slides mapping out Ukrainian military positions to assessments of international support for Ukraine and other sensitive topics, including under what circumstances Russian President Vladimir Putin might use nuclear weapons.\n\nAuthorities have not revealed an alleged motive. But members of the Discord group described Teixeira as someone looking to show off, rather than being motivated by a desire to inform the public about U.S. military operations or to influence American policy.\n\nThe Biden administration has scrambled to contain the potential diplomatic and military fallout from the leaks since they were first reported, moving to reassure allies and assess the scope of damage. There has been no clear answer on how many documents were leaked. The Associated Press has viewed approximately 50 documents; some estimates put the total number in the hundreds.",

                    "snippet": "Listen 6 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nThe Chinese military could soon deploy a high-altitude spy drone that travels at least three times the speed of sound, according to a leaked U.S. military assessment, a development that would dramatically strengthen China’s ability to conduct surveillance operations. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight A secret document from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which has not previously been reported, shows the Chinese military is making technological advances that could help it target American warships around Taiwan and military bases in the region.\n\nThe document features satellite imagery dated Aug. 9 that shows two WZ-8 rocket-propelled reconnaissance drones at an air base in eastern China, about 350 miles inland from Shanghai. The drones are a cutting-edge surveillance system that could help China gather real-time mapping data to inform strategy or carry out missile strikes in a future conflict.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe assessment says the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had “almost certainly” established its first unmanned aerial vehicle unit at the base, which falls under the Eastern Theater Command, the branch of the Chinese military responsible for enforcing Beijing’s sovereignty claims over Taiwan.\n\nThe Washington Post obtained the assessment of the WZ-8 program from a trove of images of classified files posted on Discord, a group chat service popular with gamers, allegedly by a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard.\n\nThe Defense Department declined to comment. China’s Ministry of National Defense did not respond to a faxed request for comment.\n\nOther documents in the trove detail a number of disclosures about Chinese spying and military modernization, including intelligence that revealed the existence of additional Chinese spy balloons and an assessment that Taiwan is ill-prepared to prevent early Chinese air superiority during an invasion.\n\nThis latest revelation about the advancement comes as intensifying military aggression around Taiwan has heightened concern about a Chinese invasion on the self-governed island democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCIA Director William J. Burns has said Chinese leader Xi Jinping wants the PLA to be capable of seizing Taiwan by 2027, although he added that this does not mean Xi will order an attack at that time.\n\nBeijing introduced the WZ-8 drones in 2019 when two of the jet-black aircraft were paraded past Tiananmen Square during celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the Communist Party-run People’s Republic of China. Few analysts considered the drones fully operational at the time.\n\nAlso included in the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s assessment are possible flight paths for the drone as well as for the twin-engine H6-M Badger bomber used to launch it. After taking off from its home air base, the warplane would fly to just off China’s east coast before releasing the stealthy drone, which could then enter Taiwanese or South Korean airspace at a height of 100,000 feet and fly three times the speed of sound. The document does not detail how the drone is propelled but says “engine features are primarily associated with rocket fuel.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA map of projected routes, labeled “not necessarily authoritative,” suggests ways the drone’s “Electro-optical” cameras and sensors could gather intelligence on Taiwan’s main island and the western side of South Korea including Seoul, the capital city. The use of synthetic aperture radar would allow it to map territory at night and foggy weather.\n\nThe drone’s primary use won’t be against Taiwan but against the United States and its military bases in the Pacific, said Chi Li-pin, director of the aeronautical systems research division at the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, Taiwan’s military-run weapons developer. “It’s a weapon for anti-access and area denial,” he said.\n\nChi added that the aircraft does not currently appear to be designed to launch attacks, but he noted modifications could allow it to conduct strikes in future. “It is difficult to detect and intercept. The existing U.S. air-to-air weapons aren’t good enough,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDean Cheng, a nonresident senior fellow with the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies, said the disclosure shows China is developing a capability to monitor the entire Indo-Pacific region. “This is not just aimed at the United States or South Korea,” said Cheng, who had not seen the documents. “Japan has to worry about it. India has to worry about it. All Southeast Asia has to worry about it.”\n\nChina, he noted, is creating a range of high-tech systems for military use — from hypersonic weapons that can use drone reconnaissance for anti-ship purposes to antisatellite weapons that they could use to try to blind the United States. “Individually, none of these things are game-changers,” he said. “Taken together, we’re looking at a PLA that is developing a reconnaissance strike complex: Find the enemy, hit the enemy, kill the enemy.”\n\nThe airfield described in the document as “Liuan” appears to be a base in Dushan County of Lu’an city, according to coordinates in the document. (The first Chinese character in Lu’an is often pronounced ‘liu’ but it is ‘lu’ in this instance.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was originally built in 1970, part of leader Mao Zedong’s campaign to move crucial industries and military installations into mountainous regions, prompted after relations with the Soviet Union soured and left China’s communist leadership feeling vulnerable to attack. The hangars of the original air base, known then as the 8301 airfield, were burrowed into the hillside and had steel-plated doors that were 12 inches thick, according to Chinese state media.\n\nA review of satellite imagery publicly available on Google Earth and provided to The Post by Planet Labs shows the base has expanded multiple times in recent years, with at least 18 new structures constructed after August 2020. Beginning in late February 2022, new, significantly wider thoroughfares that lead into the hills south of the runway were constructed. In some places, the new clearing is about 130 feet wide.\n\nEnthusiasts who use open-source material to track the Chinese air force believe the base is home to a regiment of the Eastern Theater’s 10th bomber division, the branch most likely to conduct air attacks if China launches a full-scale assault on Taiwan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoseph Wen, a Taipei-based independent analyst who tracks military installations in China, says that the base was abandoned for years. It was even used as a filming location for a patriotic action film about the Sino-Japanese War.\n\nBut there have been clear signs since 2019 that the base has been brought back into service. Wen has tracked a flurry of construction activity, included widening the paths that lead to the southern cavern entrance to nearly 130 feet. The wingspan of the bomber plane used to launch the drone is 108 feet.\n\nMeg Kelly contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

                    "snippet": "A Department of Defense assessment of locations proposed to build offshore wind farms on the Atlantic coast found several areas to be “highly problematic” due to their proximity to U.S. military training sites, Bloomberg reported on Monday, publishing a Pentagon map of the areas in question.\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson confirmed to Fox News on the same day that the warnings published by Bloomberg were an authentic assessment of proposed areas for offshore wind development, stating that the Defense Department would “continue to work” with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), responsible for greenlighting the offshore wind deals, to find the “best locations for development.”\n\n\"The Pentagon is sounding alarms over Biden administration plans to advance offshore wind projects along the central Atlantic US coast, warning that almost all of the new terrain eyed for development conflicts with military operations.\" 😬https://t.co/AowhqJCziy pic.twitter.com/H9JUvj32R9 — Scott Lincicome (@scottlincicome) April 17, 2023\n\nThe assessment, dated October 2022, is the latest complication for President Joe Biden’s sweeping plans to replace much of the current American power grid with offshore wind turbines. Two large-scale projects approved for development off the coast of New Jersey – the Ocean Wind I and II planned farms, developed and owned by the Danish company Ørsted – have triggered protests attracting hundreds of people along the Jersey shore. Protesters, supported by local Congressmen Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ) and Chris Smith (R-NJ), have expressed alarm that the wind projects will kill off local maritime ecosystems, devastating the local tourism and fishing industries.\n\nMany also accuse preliminary work to find locations to build the wind farms, which requires sonar, of adversely affecting the echolocation abilities of marine mammals, leading to a surge in the number of dead whales and dolphins washing ashore. BOEM and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have both denied any relationship between the dead marine mammals and offshore wind development.\n\nThe Pentagon map published on Monday by Bloomberg concerns waters off the coasts of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware, far to the south of the Ocean Wind projects. According to the outlet, the Defense Department warned that the Navy and Air Force would struggle to engage in routine operations should wind turbines be erected near North Carolina’s Dare County bombing range and a weapons station in Yorktown Virginia, among other areas. These are the “highly problematic” areas in red.\n\n“Four of six potential wind lease areas outlined by the ocean energy bureau last November are completely shaded red, including two deep-water parcels that might require floating turbines,” Bloomberg detailed. “The remaining two tracts, in yellow, are identified as requiring further study. The areas deemed highest priority by the Pentagon span a large portion of potential lease areas off the Maryland and North Carolina coasts.”\n\nBloomberg reported that the assessment “spooked” potential investors in wind energy.\n\nResponding to a request from Fox News regarding the Bloomberg report, Defense Department spokesperson Kelly Flynn confirmed, “the initial assessment performed by DoD found complicated compatibility challenges with wind turbines near Navy and Air Force training.”\n\nDiscussions regarding potential locations for windfarms continue, Flynn added, and listed the concerns involved as including “impacts to the environment, shipping, fishing, viewshed and military readiness.” The discussion also includes, Flynn continued, “mitigation strategies to overcome the impacts.”\n\nThe spokesperson described the October documents as “the first step in the process,” leaving the door open for the Pentagon to later approve modified proposals.\n\nThe concerns in the Bloomberg report differ from potential national security problems raised during a Congressional hearing in Wildwood, New Jersey, chaired by Rep. Van Drew in March. Testifying to multiple regional lawmakers, Meghan Lapp, the fisheries liaison for the Rhode Island commercial fishing company Seafreeze, said that she had attempted to address national security concerns with BOEM to no avail, expressing concern with potential radar interference and blocking military and civilian missions.\n\n“NASA has said that these areas interfere with all their missions out of Wallops Island; the Navy has said there is not an area in that whole lease block that does not interfere with DOD [Department of Defense] missions, but BOEM [the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] is continuing ahead,” Lapp explained.\n\n“When I’ve asked them [BOEM] on webinars, like – the Navy said that this is a problem how can you still be leasing it?” she recalled, “‘Well, we’re just going to be continuing the discussions.’”\n\nRobert Stern, a former director of the Office of Environmental Compliance at U.S. Department of Energy who also testified at the hearing, noted that one of the proposed wind farm locations lies between nine to 14 miles out of Long Beach Island, a barrier island off the coast of New Jersey, and appears to conflict with Pentagon exclusion territory.\n\n“The first half of the side [of one of the wind farm leases] off LBI from about nine to 14 miles out is labeled by the Navy as a DOD exclusion zone,” Stern said. “We tried to contact DOD to find out what that means; we could not get any information, maybe it’s classified, I don’t know.”\n\n“But right now, you have a lease area out there, half of which is classified as a DOD exclusion zone and, as Meghan [Lapp] indicates, all you get from BOEM is ‘we’re working out with DOD’ … I’d rather hear something from DOD,” Stern said.\n\nAt the hearing, Rep. Smith recalled prior studies indicating that “vessel navigation including U.S. Navy ships, merchant ships, and search and rescue operations … their radars will be compromised.”\n\nIn 2022, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published a report concluding “wind turbine generators have significant electromagnetic reflectivity, and therefore can interfere with radar systems operating nearby.”\n\n“The rotating blades can also create reflections in Doppler radar systems. In particular, these forms of interference could obfuscate smaller vessels and stationary objects such as buoys on radar, complicating navigation decisions and increasing the risk of collision with larger vessels,” a summary by the Academies of the report read.\n\nRep. Van Drew issued a statement on Monday again calling for a moratorium on offshore wind development in light of military concerns.\n\n“This President and this administration continue to disregard these valid concerns, and now the Pentagon is reiterating the potential impacts the industrialization of our coast will have on our national security,” the Congressman said. “We need to put America first and we need a moratorium on these projects until it is far too late.”\n\nBloomberg reported that BOEM responded to its revelation of the Pentagon report by stating that America is “well positioned to satisfy state and federal offshore wind goals as we develop the clean energy economy.” It also noted that supporters of wind energy have dismissed the military’s concerns by arguing that relying on fossil fuels is its own national security threat.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

                    "snippet": "Alexander Vindman, the retired lieutenant colonel who rose to particular prominence for his role in helping expose a pressure campaign from then-President Trump and allies of his targeting the Ukrainian government and seeking politically helpful dirt on Donald’s opponents, is facing new vitriol from the Right. This time, they’re apparently accusing him of having leaked protected information, for which it would seem there is no real-world evidence — at all.\n\nThe deceptive idea about Vindman is circulating amid controversy about the actions of Jack Teixeira, a member of the Air National Guard who distributed protected military secrets outside the government and has since been criminally charged. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has helped lead a charge of treating Teixeira as some kind of national hero, although since the guardsman didn’t even personally distribute the disputed materials very far, it’s unclear he saw himself as a whistleblower. As for Vindman, he eventually testified to Congress about the situation with Trump targeting Ukraine, which wouldn’t be classified as the same kind of thing Teixeira did. Before that point, it’s been documented how Vindman sought assistance with his concerns inside the federal entity known as the National Security Council. He himself wasn’t the whistleblower who eventually filed a complaint that helped break everything open.\n\n“I never leaked a thing & dutifully protected classified information,” Vindman said on Twitter. “Anyone that says otherwise is making baseless defamatory statements. @realDonaldTrump is likely going to jail over the allegations of mishandling classified. Cleaning up any remaining questions.” Vindman also tagged Donald Trump Jr., since the former president’s son has recently helped spread those false accusations to which Vindman was replying. Bizarrely, Trump Jr. accused Vindman of having pushed the world towards World War III, which doesn’t really track with reality.\n\nIt’s true that, as Vindman referenced, the former president himself remains under federal investigation for the mishandling of classified documents from his time in office, something that could result in criminal charges. Early reports have suggested prosecutors have been assembling evidence potentially indicating Trump intentionally deceived his personal legal team about the status of protected materials he still had as government authorities sought their return throughout last year.\n\nI never leaked a thing & dutifully protected classified information. Anyone that says otherwise is making baseless defamatory statements. @realDonaldTrump is likely going to jail over the allegations of mishandling classified.

                    "top_image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/643ebef91e7355e051644d0a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/vf323-nyt-leak.jpg",
                    "snippet": "The New York Times discovered the identity of Jack Teixeira, the Air National Guard member charged with leaking a trove of classified Pentagon documents related to the war in Ukraine, around the same time the FBI found him. In court records, the FBI said, somewhat vaguely, that it found Teixeira through social media. The Times investigations team ultimately did it by matching photographs of kitchen counters—and with the heavy lift from a journalist who’d never been published by the Times before.\n\nLast week, Aric Toler tweeted that he’d landed his first byline in the Times. Some 30 minutes later he tweeted his second byline, declaring it “a slightly bigger deal than the first.” You may have missed the posts, lost among the other journalists promoting their work on the platform. Notable though, was that Toler’s first bylines were helping identify the source of the biggest classified-documents leak since Edward Snowden.\n\nToler, a 34-year-old Kansas City–based “digital digger,” as he puts it, is a researcher at Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based open-source news operation. He was the first person to report that the leaked documents came from a very small channel on Discord, a social network popular with gamers: On April 9, Toler told the “improbable” story of how the documents had made their way from Discord to 4Chan and Telegram. “I actually had no desire to find the leaker at the time. I was more just interested in, like, where this came from,” Toler tells me. Bizarrely, he said, the documents were posted in Discord channels focused on the Minecraft computer game and a Filipino YouTube celebrity. Toler traced the original source of the documents back even further, to a Discord server called Thug Shaker Central.\n\nThat’s when the Times stepped in. Toler had already been in touch with Christiaan Triebert, a reporter on the paper’s Visual Investigations team who used to work at Bellingcat, who’d also been digging into this. “We don’t often do this, to be honest,” Mark Scheffler, who leads the Times’ Visual Investigations unit, says of having a freelancer on such a story. “We have a team. But this was a vexing and very competitive target and, you know, we just thought, Why not? Let’s get some more firepower in the mix.” And Toler “does not come out of the blue,” Scheffler adds. “We’ve always been looking for ways to work with him.” Still, he notes, “What an amazing way to kick things off.”\n\nThus began the wild chase for the leaker. “I’d been talking to a few of these people from this Discord channel where all the files were dumped in the first place,” Toler says. He learned that the original leaker worked at a military facility and used to play certain video games with some of the users, so Toler used a website that scrapes and archives information from Steam—a digital platform where users buy and play video games—to “look at the intersection of who was friends with all these people,” he says. Toler, working with members of the Times Visual Investigations team, found someone with the user name jackdjdtex, who Toler says “had a bunch of military stuff on there” and “screenshots of him playing Project Zomboid, screenshots of him playing Arma 3”—games, as they’d been told by a former member of Thug Shaker Central, that the original leaker played. One of those screenshots showed a different handle he had used, J. Teixeira. Social media accounts led them to Teixeira, and importantly, to a picture of him in a military uniform in the kitchen of his childhood home. The countertops in that photo matched the surface the leaked documents had been photographed on.\n\n“Where I normally would’ve hit a brick wall with this Bellingcat work, the Times can kind of go to the next step from there,” Toler says. Once the team had identified Teixiera as a person of interest, they dispatched reporters to his house in Massachusetts. By that time, the authorities had already identified him and were preparing to make an arrest. The Times published its story.\n\nToler’s byline on the pieces—which you can’t even click on for a bio—represents a unique departure for a legacy institution like the Times. “Established media—I know because I come from nonestablished media—has been tricky with crediting people sometimes, or working together,” says Triebert. The Visual Investigations team has been able to do both with Toler in recent days. “That’s credit where credit is due,” says Triebert.\n\nMeanwhile, Toler—who, prior to joining Bellingcat in 2014, did a stint at Bank of America, and before that got a masters degree in Slavic languages and literatures—is almost comically nonchalant about his role in all of this. He says it was “fun” and “exhausting” and, sure, he’d consider working with the Times again. Oh, and “the FBI called me,” he says (this was before he started working with the Times). “They’re probably listening to me right now.”\n\n“The FBI was like, ‘We’d like to meet with you to talk about this stuff,’” he tells me. “I was like, ‘Can I just tell them no and make them go away?’”\n\nThe lawyers at Bellingcat told him he could. He didn’t take the meeting.",

                    "snippet": "Just what a judge said when a former Australian intelligence officer was jailed three years ago - in a court case cloaked in an unprecedented level of secrecy - has finally been revealed.\n\nAn ex-spy, dubbed Witness J and known in court by the pseudonym Alan Johns, was locked up in complete secrecy, after he threatened to extort highly classified national security information out of the belief he had been wronged.\n\nThe case was kept almost entirely behind closed doors - until recently - under national security laws.\n\nBut ACT Justice John Burns's sentencing remarks for the man dubbed Witness J were made public on Wednesday after the attorney-general launched a review of the country's national security laws.\n\nACT Justice John Burns found the man disclosed sensitive information in order to persuade those he was dealing with to comply with his wishes.\n\nWitness J, also known under the pseudonym Alan Johns, was jailed for 15 months after he was found to have extorted highly classified information (above, at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia)\n\nJohns made a series of complaints over an unsecured platform that included classified information after his security clearance was revoked and he was fired.\n\nOne of five charges occurred over a period of an unspecified number of months and only stopped when Johns was arrested.\n\nHe was sentenced to two years and seven months in prison and spent 15 months behind bars before being released in mid-2019.\n\nThe now retired judge said he accepted Johns' distrust of official complaints processes, but it didn't mitigate the nature of the offending.\n\nMr Burns said while there was no evidence the information was passed on to third parties or that national security was harmed - which would have made the charges more serious - it didn't discount the nature of the offence.\n\nBut he also contended the court may never know if Australia's national security had been contravened due to his actions.\n\n'There was a clear risk, albeit slight, that sensitive or confidential material may be disseminated ... with potentially significant consequences,' Mr Burns said in his remarks.\n\n'I accept this was not intended to be published to the world at large but it was a publication that carried with it a real, if not particularly significant risk, that it may be ... disseminated.'\n\nBut Mr Burns said Johns' actions could only be considered to be a threat, despite him not intending to carry it out.\n\n'This was not merely an exercise in venting anger or frustration,' he said.\n\n'Your purpose in doing so could only have been to remind those that you were dealing with that you could hurt ... Australia's security interests by disclosing the material in your possession.'\n\nJohns' defence lawyers contended his actions were a grave lapse of judgment and were not malicious as he didn't set out to deliberately harm national security.\n\nJohns disclosed classified information on an unsecured platform after his security clearance was revoked and he was fired\n\nMr Burns said while he accepted Johns didn't act in a malicious manner, he had to be aware of the gravity of his actions due to his long history in intelligence organisations.\n\n'You were grossly reckless in your conduct because of your anger,' he said.\n\nOne doctor contended Johns' history of depression impaired his thinking when faced with what he perceived to be unfair treatment but wasn't the main factor.\n\nReleasing Mr Burns' sentencing remarks, ACT Chief Justice Lucy McCallum said the court had given appropriate scrutiny as to what was made public in the highly redacted remarks.\n\n'Secrecy is anathema to the rule of law,' she said.\n\nBut the chief justice said the logic of some secrecy in the case was clear.\n\nAustralia's national security watchdog chastised the unprecedented secrecy around the case, which only came to light after Johns launched legal action against the jail for tipping off police about a memoir he was writing.\n\nKieran Pender from the Human Rights Law Centre said secret trials had no place in Australia's justice system and should never be allowed to happen again.\n\n'Secret trials have a long history in authoritarian states. They have no place in democracies like Australia where open justice is a fundamental protection of human rights,' the senior lawyer said.\n\nAttorney-General Mark Dreyfus chastised the secrecy of the former coalition government, saying a completely secret trial was inconsistent with the rule of law.\n\n'Court proceedings, including judgments and reasons, should be as open as possible whilst ensuring national security information is protected,' he said.\n\nA review of Australia's national security laws is due in November.",

                    "snippet": "You know that you're supposed to wipe your smartphone or laptop before you resell it or give it to your cousin. After all, there's a lot of valuable personal data on there that should stay in your control. Businesses and other institutions need to take the same approach, deleting their information from PCs, servers, and network equipment so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. At the RSA security conference in San Francisco next week, though, researchers from the security firm ESET will present findings showing that more than half of secondhand enterprise routers they bought for testing had been left completely intact by their previous owners. And the devices were brimming with network information, credentials, and confidential data about the institutions they had belonged to.\n\nThe researchers bought 18 used routers in different models made by three mainstream vendors: Cisco, Fortinet, and Juniper Networks. Of those, nine were just as their owners had left them and fully accessible, while only five had been properly wiped. Two were encrypted, one was dead, and one was a mirror copy of another device.\n\nAll nine of the unprotected devices contained credentials for the organization's VPN, credentials for another secure network communication service, or hashed root administrator passwords. And all of them included enough identifying data to determine who the previous owner or operator of the router had been.\n\nEight of the nine unprotected devices included router-to-router authentication keys and information about how the router connected to specific applications used by the previous owner. Four devices exposed credentials for connecting to the networks of other organizations—like trusted partners, collaborators, or other third parties. Three contained information about how an entity could connect as a third party to the previous owner's network. And two directly contained customer data.\n\n“A core router touches everything in the organization, so I know all about the applications and the character of the organization—it makes it very, very easy to impersonate the organization,” says Cameron Camp, the ESET security researcher who led the project. “In one case, this large group had privileged information about one of the very large accounting firms and a direct peering relationship with them. And that’s where to me it starts to get really scary, because we’re researchers, we’re here to help, but where are the rest of those routers?\"\n\nThe big danger is that the wealth of information on the devices would be valuable to cybercriminals and even state-backed hackers. Corporate application logins, network credentials, and encryption keys have high value on dark web markets and criminal forums. Attackers can also sell information about individuals for use in identity theft and other scamming.\n\nDetails about how a corporate network operates and the digital structure of an organization are also extremely valuable, whether you're doing reconnaissance to launch a ransomware attack or plotting an espionage campaign. For example, routers may reveal that a particular organization is running outdated versions of applications or operating systems that contain exploitable vulnerabilities, essentially giving hackers a road map of possible attack strategies. And the researchers even found details on some routers about the physical building security of the previous owners' offices.",

                    "snippet": "The U.S. Intelligence Community has “grown out of control” and must be reigned in, according to former National Security Council (NSC) chief of staff and CIA official Fred Fleitz, who claimed recently that leaked information suggests the Biden administration “was misleading the American people on a variety of accounts.”\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News Monday, America First Policy Institute for American Security Vice Chair Fred Fleitz, who served as deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, discussed the actions of alleged Pentagon leaker Jack Teixeira.\n\nAsked about the fact that a 21-year-old Airman First Class, the third lowest enlisted rank in the Air Force, who enlisted in 2019 and was serving as a “cyber transport systems journeyman” — essentially an IT technician — managed to access top secret military data, Fleitz argued that “it [actually] does add up.”\n\n“From what I’ve read, this guy had access to something called the Joint Chiefs of Staff J2 intelligence daily, and about 5,000 people have access to that,” he said. “He also apparently had access to something called Intellipedia — a classified Wikipedia.”\n\n“Now, if he had access to that, he also had access to something called Intellink — a classified Internet,” he added. “There are thousands of classified websites on Intellink and he would have been able to access the J2 intelligence update; Intellipedia and many other classified documents if he had access to this.”\n\nFleitz explains how such a system reflects several problems, including the fact that “too many people in the U.S. government have access to very sensitive intelligence that they don’t have a need to know, and that has to be addressed.”\n\nIn addition, with electronic dissemination, “huge numbers of people can access all kinds of stuff that they could not have accessed before, and it’s created a real security problem.”\n\nAnother problem he cites is that the Intelligence Community “has grown out of control.”\n\nRelated: Top House Intel. Dem: Biden Admin. Is Too Casual on Alleged Classified Doc Leak\n\n“There are now 18 intelligence agencies, each one of them fighting for more personnel, and when they hire more people, they demand access,” he said.\n\n“We have so many people — so much duplication — who have clearances for matters they don’t have a need to know,” he added.\n\nAs such, he suggests, much work is needed to “get control of clearances and to get control of the out-of-control growth of our intelligence agencies.”\n\nHowever, according to Fleitz, the leak is “not as bad as people think.”\n\n“The Snowden leaks were much worse,” he said. “It’s bad. It’s embarrassing. It reveals information that the U.S. government knew about other countries that we didn’t want them to know and, frankly, this material in these leaks, I don’t think the Biden administration wanted the American people to know.”\n\n“But I think that the Biden administration and Congress are going to have to work together to come up with some really aggressive ways to restrict access to this material to the people who need it,” he added.\n\nHe slammed the fact that a National Guardsman had access to all this information and that a mere technician working in a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) could “pull off” removing it from the site.\n\n“Now I know he was on detail at Fort Bragg doing computer tech stuff, but apparently there was no auditing; there was no record of him opening the same classified documents every day and printing documents that he had no need to know,” he said.\n\n“There should have been some type of a safeguard that would have detected that this low-level person was routinely accessing sensitive information that he did not have a need to know,” he added.\n\nFleitz cited two additional lessons from the incident.\n\nFirstly, the U.S. government “has to do a much better job at vetting people who have access to sensitive information.”\n\n“There has to be a much better campaign to remind and educate them that they have to keep their word to protect this material,” he said.\n\nRelated: Dem Rep. Spanberger on Biden Downplaying Leak: Any Leak Is ‘Completely’ Bad\n\n\n\nIn addition, he argued, intelligence agencies need “better” investigations, including investigations of unauthorized access and of legitimate leaks, “and really tough investigations of re-upping clearances.”\n\n“I think we’ve really fallen behind the eight ball on that,” he said. “We have to do a much better job.”\n\nNoting that the FBI was likely “already monitoring him and had decided not to move in on him” at the time the media broke the story, Fleitz expressed concern over the fact the FBI “did not arrest him right away.”\n\n“I guess they were waiting for him to do something, but it worries me that if you don’t move in on something like this quickly, they might get away,” he said.\n\nOn the Biden administration’s downplaying events, Fleitz said it was “sadly, a typical response from Biden, and I don’t think he knows what’s going on.”\n\nYet, he noted, “it does appear that some of this information suggests that the Biden administration was misleading the American people on a variety of accounts.”\n\n“That the Ukrainian army is doing much worse than known; they don’t have enough missiles to get through the next few months,” he said, “and that Taiwan is much more vulnerable than what is generally known; that it could be very vulnerable to missiles fired from China.”\n\nWhile that “doesn’t justify the leak” because “the ends don’t justify the means,” Fleitz said the information would “need to be explained” and Congress “will have to act on that, too.”\n\n“If that material wasn’t briefed to Congress, and I hope that it was, it is going to have to relay all that to the administration because the Biden administration is supposed to share information with Congress,” he said.\n\n“Congress is supposed to be kept currently and fully informed about intelligence matters and these are matters I hope Congress is well aware of,” he added.\n\nFleitz called the recent leak of Chinese spy balloons traversing the skies of America a “good example” of the issue.\n\nRelated: GOP Rep. Steube: We Need to Investigate Biden ‘Lying’ about Spy Balloon\n\n“It appears there are more spy balloons the administration lied to the American people about and this intelligence reveals that, though it doesn’t justify what this person did,” he said.\n\nIf Teixeira “was a whistleblower, which he clearly wasn’t,” Fleitz suggested, “there are channels you can go through to report information like this, such as going to the intelligence oversight committees or into a SCIF to tell a member of Congress or a congressional staff member what you know and then leave.”\n\n“Leaking classified information to the media because you object to something going on in the government — that’s never the way to go because of the [massive] damage you could do to national security,” he concluded.\n\nThe matter comes after FBI agents arrested on Thursday 21-year-old Massachusetts resident Jack Douglas Teixeira, who is accused of leaking over a hundred purportedly classified documents, many of them pertaining to the Ukraine war.\n\nAccording to reports, he frequently presented these documents as evidence that every government involved in the conflict is lying to its citizens about the progress of the war.\n\nHe also allegedly posted materials related to other news stories, including foreign interference in U.S. elections, U.S. interference in foreign governments, and how intelligence officials were aware of as many as four other Chinese spy balloons aside from the one reported earlier this year.\n\nFollow Joshua Klein on Twitter @JoshuaKlein.",

                    "snippet": "By William L. Anderson\n\nMost readers might not remember Daniel Ellsberg, but for those of us who came of age during the Vietnam War, the maelstrom that formed around him and his actions helped to define that era. Ellsberg, of course, is famous because he leaked a number of internal government documents called the Pentagon Papers in which the writers expressed skepticism about the chances for U.S. success in the Vietnam War.\n\nEllsberg chose to leak to the New York Times and the Washington Post, which at that time (as well as today) were the print voices of the political and academic elites. By 1971, when the papers printed some of the documents (after the U.S. Supreme Court voted 6-3 to allow publication), the war was well out of favor with the Democratic Party – whose politicians had started the war in the first place – and it had been three years since Walter Cronkite denounced it on his evening broadcast.\n\nThe Richard Nixon administration, which had inherited the war and expanded it into neighboring Cambodia, charged Ellsberg with violating the Espionage Act of 1917, but the courts dismissed the charges in 1973 because of government misconduct. Ellsberg has been a free man since then and has been a celebrity in elite circles. (I saw him at a 2007 conference sponsored by the Future of Freedom Foundation. We gave him a standing ovation.)\n\nJack Texeira, the Massachusetts Air National guardsman who is accused of leaking U.S. Government documents relating to the Ukraine war and other U.S. interventions elsewhere, is unlikely to enjoy Ellsberg’s celebrity status with the progressive elites. Like Ellsberg, he is charged with violating the Espionage Act of 1917; unlike Ellsberg, the recipient of the allegedly leaked documents was a website that clearly does not have favor of the NYT or the Post.\n\nIndependent journalist Matt Taibbi writes:\n\nOn a flight, reading about the FBI’s arrest of Jack Texeira, already dubbed the “Pentagon Leaker.” A quick review reveals multiple media portraits already out depicting him as a dangerous incel who shared his wares on Discord, a social media app where “racist memes” and “offensive jokes” flourish.\n\nTaibbi adds that the Post labeled him as a “gun enthusiast” as a means to further discredit him. Unlike Ellsberg, Teixeira will not have Ivy League law professors representing him, nor will the editorial pages of the nation’s elite newspapers defend him. Indeed, the NYT has boasted about how it found the identity of the alleged leaker before government authorities did. David French, who recently became a columnist for the NYT and since has used his new journalistic perch to shill for unlimited American involvement in the Ukraine war, has condemned both Teixeira and his defenders on Twitter, calling them “repulsive.” The alleged leaks, declares French, “can do immense damage.” Tom Nichols in The Atlantic has declared him to be a “narcissist” endangering America.\n\nIn the past, elite media has defended leaks of government documents, especially when it is clear that government officials have been lying. Unfortunately, in this new age of progressive media, the press now plays detective for the government if the leaks come from the “wrong” people. Taibbi writes:\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post trumpeted roles in helping identify Air National Guardsman Teixiera for the FBI. “We’re delivering him to you with his head on a platter,” is how Glenn (Greenwald) put it.\n\nOf course, one must ask what it means to be “endangering America.” The Pentagon Papers did not change the outcome of the war; indeed, by the time they were released the Nixon administration already was looking for a “peace with honor” way out of the conflict. If anything was endangered, it was the reputations of members of the Lyndon Johnson and Nixon administrations that had lied to Americans about the conduct and outcomes of the war.\n\nActivist Post is Google-Free\n\nSupport us for just $1 per month at Patreon or SubscribeStar\n\nLikewise, the document leaks that came from Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and Julian Assange did not place ordinary Americans – or even American military personnel – in danger of their lives. Instead, they exposed how American politicians, military, and executive branch officials have lied to Americans, all the while claiming their lies were necessary to “protect” America.\n\nBefore going further with the government’s case against Teixeira, we also should address the fact that members of the national security establishment have been leaking documents for years, but that is considered good because the political goals of the leakers are seen to be sacrosanct. Taibbi writes:\n\nThe intelligence community has itself been massively interfering in domestic news using illegal leaks for years. Remember the “Why Did Obama Dawdle on Russia’s Hacking?” story by David Ignatius of the Washington Post in January of 2017, outing would-be Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn as having been captured in intercepts speaking with a Russian ambassador? That was just the first in a string of leak- or intercept-based news stories that dominated news cycles in the Trump years, involving everything from conclusions of the FISA court to supposedly secret meetings in the Seychelles. When civilians or whistleblowers like Edward Snowden, Julian Assange (in jail for an incredible four years now), Reality Winner and now the “Discord Leaker” bring leaked information to the public, the immediate threat is Espionage Act charges and decades of jail time. When a CIA head or a top FBI official does it, it’s just news. In fact, officials talk openly about using “strategic leaks” as a P.R. staple. In a world where media currency is becoming the ultimate power, these people want a monopoly. It’s infuriating.\n\nThe sad irony continues as the Post editorial board, which now apparently believes that democracy needs darkness – or at least properly-orchestrated media blackouts from the truth – has denounced the leak in an editorial. There will be no protections for Teixeira, no appeals from the media, as nothing is permitted to stand in the way of the Biden administration’s proxy war against Russia. Writes Jordan Schactel:\n\nIt seems there is a concerted effort in the legacy press to paint a personal picture of Mr. Teixeira as an anti-government Trump-loving right winger who is undeserving of whistleblower protections. It’s not that he’s harming the reputation of the Current Thing . . . He’s religious! He loves guns! He’s a “MAGAt!” Blue Anons, activated!\n\nIn other words, Teixeira does not fit into the favored media category and so he must face the full wrath of the government for allegedly violating the Espionage Act (Section 793 of the Federal Code) and Section 1924, unauthorized removal of classified documents. (Note that both Biden and Donald Trump have allegedly violated Section 1924, but it is doubtful that either will be perp-walked for their transgressions.)\n\nTaibbi further notes that not long ago, the New York Times was willing to expose much more sensitive material and even partner with Julian Assange, something that one cannot even imagine today:\n\nFor the Times, this symbolized a complete turnaround from just 12 years ago, when it partnered with Julian Assange to print “The War Logs,” a far more damaging set of leaks. Just one of those Wikileaks-based stories, “Pakistan Aids Insurgency in Afghanistan, Reports Assert,” was probably more impactful than all the Teixeira docs combined. It described how officials in Pakistan, an ostensible American ally receiving over $1 billion from the U.S. for aid in fighting “militants,” was holding “secret strategy sessions” with the Taliban, to help organize “networks… that fight against American soldiers.”\n\nAs we saw with Alvin Bragg’s indictment of Donald Trump, prosecutors can slice up charges to create a large number of separate “crimes,” and then insist that the guilty party serve each sentence consecutively, so theoretically Teixeira could be given an effective life sentence. A violation of Section 793 can carry a maximum 10-year sentence, while violations of Section 1924 have prison sentences of up to five years. You do the math.\n\nAs Teixeira disappears into the maw known as the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, one can be sure he will be held without bond and will be spending much of his pre-trial (and probably post-trial time as well) in solitary confinement. Medical and psychological researchers have documented the pernicious effects of solitary confinement, but one doubts Teixeira will receive much sympathy on that front, especially from the groups that usually denounce such punishments, but are silent when someone from the wrong side of the political and social tracks is the victim.\n\nTeixeira is charged with the same “crime” that is regularly committed by those favored by American political, media, and academic elites. Ironically, according to the New York Times, the information that he leaked might prove helpful to the Ukrainian cause, since it points out the dire situation that Ukraine faces at the present time:\n\n…in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, this past week, there was little palpable alarm about the scores of pages of classified documents that have surfaced in one of the most remarkable disclosures of American secrets in the last decade. In fact, some welcomed the leak, hoping that it would emphasize what President Volodymyr Zelensky has been saying for months — that Ukraine urgently needs more ammunition and weapons to expel the Russian forces. “From many points of view, this leak is really useful, and good, even I can say good for Ukraine,” said Oleksiy Honcharenko, a member of Parliament in the opposition European Solidarity party.\n\nOne would think, if one believes the “Democracy Dies in Darkness” sermons we hear preached by American elites, that the Biden administration and the Pentagon should be telling people the truth about how far-reaching American involvement has been in this proxy war, especially since Russia has extensive nuclear weapons. But those folks really don’t believe their rhetoric. Instead, Jack Teixeira will soon disappear for good into prison, and, like Julian Assange who still languishes without trial, their names will be forgotten.\n\nSource: Mises Institute\n\nBecome a Patron!\n\nOr support us at SubscribeStar\n\nDonate cryptocurrency HERE\n\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.

                    "snippet": "BETHLEHEM, Pa. — The 74,000 Twitter followers of the National Weather Service forecast office in Mount Holly, New Jersey, represent just a small fraction of the people the office serves.\n\nBut it’s those people — many in the forecast area — who were at risk of not seeing the next severe weather alerts from the NWS after Twitter made a decision to limit automated tweets on its platform.\n\n\n\nTwitter originally said it would limit automated tweets on its platform, limiting severe weather alerts\n\nLate Saturday, Twitter’s development team seemingly lifted the cap and said it would allow the National Weather Service accounts to continue tweeting weather alerts without limits\n\nTwitter hasn't responded to any media requests for comment except with a poop emoji\n\nUntil Saturday, there were no exceptions to that rule — even as severe weather began to pop up across the region.\n\n“Twitter is now limiting automated tweets and as a result this account can no longer post all watches/warnings/advisories as they are issued,” a tweet from NWS Mount Holly said Saturday morning.\n\nTwitter is now limiting automated tweets and as a result this account can no longer post all watches/warnings/advisories as they are issued. We will continue to provide general updates, but ensure that you have multiple means for receiving weather information & alerts. — NWS Mount Holly (@NWS_MountHolly) April 15, 2023\n\n“We will continue to provide general updates, but ensure that you have multiple means for receiving weather information and alerts.”\n\nHours later, severe storms rumbled through the Lehigh Valley, bringing hail and 40 mph winds. A flash flood warning also was issued for Allentown, Bethlehem and surrounding municipalities.\n\nLate that night, Twitter’s development team seemingly lifted the cap and said it would let the National Weather Service accounts continue to tweet weather alerts without limits.\n\n“If you know Public Service accounts that would benefit from a similar exception, advocate for them,” the Twitter Daily News account said.\n\nNEWS: Twitter will allow the National Weather Service accounts to continue Tweeting weather alerts without limits.\n\n\n\nGreat Job @TwitterDev 👏 pic.twitter.com/0inyY9QYVO — T(w)itter Daily News  (@TitterDaily) April 16, 2023\n\nReaching the masses\n\nUnder its own policy, the NWS uses Twitter as a supplemental channel to improve weather awareness. Tweets from all of its forecast offices are used to highlight information deemed important to the weather community and the public — including severe weather.\n\nMount Holly’s coverage area alone consists of 10 counties in eastern Pennsylvania, 16 counties in New Jersey, five in Maryland and all three counties in Delaware.\n\nThe area includes Philadelphia, Allentown, Atlantic City and Wilmington, and is home to more than 11 million people.\n\nOverall, the NWS operates more than 120 weather forecast offices in six regions and each maintains its own county warning area, or CWA.\n\nWhen severe weather strikes, or threatens to, the weather service warns its followers through various methods, including automated tweets. That’s because Twitter had long allowed free access to systems that can program these posts.\n\nThat’s all changed, as Twitter owner Elon Musk moves the social platform toward more paid features. That means limiting automated tweets to just 1,500 per month for free, or as many as 50,000 for $100 a month.\n\nBut the weather service would blow past Twitter’s free threshold during any extreme weather event.\n\nIt meant tweets providing weather, hydrologic and climate forecasts and warnings for all NWS forecast offices — including those disseminated for the protection of life and property — would have been curtailed.\n\nThe decision has sparked backlash and prompted a petition on Change.org called Stop Twitter from blocking National Weather Service Automated Warnings! Save Lives!\n\n\n\nSevere Weather Awareness Week\n\nMonday, April 17, marks the start of Severe Weather Awareness Week in Pennsylvania. The effort comes before the typical onset of thunderstorm and flash flood season and involves coordination among the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, County Emergency Management Officers and the NWS.\n\nEach day during the week emphasizes a different weather hazard and provides associated safety tips.\n\nThis year, Severe Weather Awareness Week will cover:\n\n\n\nSevere thunderstorms\n\nOutlooks, watches and warnings\n\nFlash flooding\n\nTornadoes\n\nWays to become involved\n\nOn its website, the weather service advises residents to periodically check local sources for severe weather updates — including NOAA weather radio, local TV and radio and social media.\n\nThe concern was that automated weather tweets not only alert people directly, but those tweets are amplified by other accounts retweeting the same information.\n\nIt means a much larger audience would have been at risk of not getting potentially life-saving information during severe weather.\n\nTwitter has not responded to any media requests on the matter, and responded to inquiries from outlets like The Washington Post the way it has to any other media requests: with a poop emoji.\n\n\"Without this automated process, it would take minutes for forecasters to manually prepare warning information into a tweet. For every warning issued, seconds could make the difference between life and death,\" said Susan Buchanan, director of public affairs for NWS.\n\nBuchanan said a new issue also emerged when several automated accounts were suspended on Friday, April 14.\n\n\"While some of these accounts were reinstated over the weekend, some remained suspended [Monday] morning. None of those accounts had exceeded Twitter's new API limit. Those, and all other NWS accounts, can still manually issue tweets but will face the challenge of timing and staff capacity that the automated tweets do not face.\"",

Military personnel eventually shot missiles at the balloon, along with three other objects that were later determined not to be related to Chinese intelligence at all.\n\nThe spy balloon, now referred to as Killeen-23, is now known to have had a series of perplexing features after classified documents were leaked by a 21-year-old Air National Guardsman.\n\nThe documents revealed information that was as recent as 10 days after the Chinese balloon was shot down on Feb. 15, 2023, and contained specs on other previously unknown balloons.\n\nKilleen-23, along with other balloons labeled Bulger-21 and Accardo-21, were detailed in the classified documents. The balloons are named after famous criminals, including Tony Accardo, \"Whitey\" Bulger, and Donald Killeen, a government official confirmed to the Washington Post.\n\nAccording to leaked images, Killeen-23 had complex reconnaissance capabilities, which could have included \"synthetic aperture radar\" (SAR), which has the ability to see at night and penetrate the atmosphere and thin materials.\n\nSAR works by sending microwave pulses at the Earth to create images. This allows for nighttime imagery and reconnaissance that passes through objects in nature that can disrupt visibility, such as clouds, smoke, topsoil, ice, and snow.\n\nAmazingly, it can also see through thin materials such as tarps.\n\nThe balloon also had a parabolic dish with sensors and solar panels that could generate up to 10,000 watts of power. Engineers at the National Space Intelligence Center say that this could power any type of surveillance technology, including the radar.\n\n\n\nOther details of the balloon remained unknown to authorities at the time.\n\n\n\n“No imagery collections of the bottom of the Killeen-23 payload to analyze for an optical sensor,\" the documents read.\n\nBulger-21 came equipped with sophisticated surveillance equipment as well, as it circumnavigated the planet from December 2021 to May 2022. Documents also revealed that this balloon carried a “full motion video payload with a capability to zoom.”\n\nAccardo-21 too had similar equipment, but also included a \"foil-lined gimbaled\" sensor, according to the report.\n\nThe Pentagon, the Defense Department, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment to the Washington Post.\n\n\n\nLike Blaze News?

                    "snippet": "Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nPresident Biden and first lady Jill Biden on Tuesday released their 2022 tax returns, which showed they had a federal adjusted gross income of $579,514 and paid $169,820 in total taxes, an effective tax rate of 23.8 percent. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The White House announced the returns on the April 18 U.S. tax filing deadline in a relatively pedestrian news release — and made a point of saying that Biden, who served more that three decades in the Senate, has now “shared a total of 25 years of tax returns with the American public.”\n\nThat was a pointed contrast with Donald Trump, Biden’s immediate predecessor and possible future opponent. Trump never voluntarily released his tax returns as a presidential candidate or commander in chief, bucking a decades-old tradition for those seeking and occupying the nation’s highest office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden has stressed that his presidency would represent a return to presidential norms and traditions, including shoring up alliances, speaking out against authoritarianism and, as Tuesday’s release suggests, detailing his obligations to Uncle Sam.\n\nThe Bidens contributed $20,180 to 20 different charities in 2022, the returns show. The largest donation, $5,000, was to the Beau Biden Foundation, which works to protect children from abuse. The charity was set up in honor of Biden’s late son, the former attorney general of Delaware, who died of cancer in 2015.\n\nThe first couple also donated $2,000 to the National Fraternal Order of Police Foundation and $1,680 to St. Joseph on the Brandywine, their home church parish, which the president routinely visits during weekends at home in Delaware. Biden, a lifelong Catholic, attends Mass on a weekly basis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2021, Biden’s first year as president, the Bidens reported a federal adjusted gross income of $610,702 and federal income tax payments of $150,439, at an effective rate of 24.6 percent.\n\nWhile the Bidens are now millionaires, the president has long stressed his middle-class background, including his upbringing in Scranton, Pa., and his family’s financial struggles, which factored into their relocation to Delaware. In his speeches, the president periodically says that he “had the great pleasure of being listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years.”\n\nHe also speaks repeatedly of having taken the Amtrak home every night when he was in the Senate as he commuted back and forth between the capital and his home in Delaware.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, when Biden signed an executive order on child care and elder care, he recounted how his sister moved in with him after his first wife died because he needed help raising his two sons on a senator’s salary. Those memories, he has said, factored into his vow to never raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House on Tuesday also released the federal returns of Vice President Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff, as well as their state returns for California and the District of Columbia. In total, Harris has released 19 years of tax returns during her long career in public service.\n\nHarris and Emhoff reported federal adjusted gross income of $456,918 and a payment of $93,570 in federal income tax for 2022, an effective federal income tax rate of 20.5 percent.\n\nA year earlier, Harris and Emhoff reported a federal adjusted gross income of $1,655,563 with an effective tax rate of 31.6 percent. A large chunk of that income was Emhoff’s earnings from DLA Piper and Venable, the law firms where he worked before leaving the legal field when Harris was elected vice president.\n\nIn 2022, the second couple contributed $23,000 to charity, including $5,000 apiece to Howard University, where Harris obtained her bachelor’s degree, and the University of Southern California, where Emhoff earned his law degree.\n\nTrump, during his presidency, vigorously fought efforts by congressional Democrats and prosecutors to obtain his tax records, saying he could not release them because he was under audit. In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled against Trump and in favor of a Manhattan district attorney who was seeking the documents.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

The White House also released tax returns showing Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff made $456,918 last year, a significant decline in their income from 2021, when they sold a residence.\n\nThe president and first lady paid $169,820 in combined federal, Delaware, and Virginia income taxes last year. Of that, they owed $137,658 to the federal government, which resulted in an effective federal income tax rate of 23.8%.\n\nTheir joint income mostly consisted of the president’s $400,000 annual salary, set by Congress, along with pensions. The first couple brought in a little more than $5,000 from two S Corporations – CelticCapri Corp. and Giacoppa Corp. – which the White House has said previously were set up to receive royalties from their writing and speaking engagements.\n\nThe income from those corporations was down significantly from a year prior, when they brought in almost $62,000.\n\nThe first lady earned $82,335 from her teaching position at Northern Virginia Community College.\n\nThe Bidens donated $20,180 to 20 different charities in 2022, including $5,000 to the Beau Biden Foundation. The charity, named after the president’s late son, is aimed at protecting children from abuse.\n\nOther organizations that the couple gave to include the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, a group that offers support to grieving military families, as well as St. Joseph on the Brandywine, a Catholic church that the Bidens attend in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nThe 2022 returns are mostly in line with the taxes filed one year prior, when the Bidens earned $610,702 and paid $150,439 in federal income taxes at a rate of 24.6%.\n\nHarris and Emhoff owed $93,570 in federal income taxes with an effective federal income tax rate of 20.5%.\n\nHarris and Emhoff contributed $23,000 to charity last year, including $5,000 each to Howard University and the University of Southern California, the vice president’s and second gentleman’s respective alma maters.\n\nThe White House restored the practice of releasing the president’s and vice president’s tax returns in a show of transparency after it was eschewed by the Trump administration.\n\n“Once again demonstrating his commitment to being transparent with the American people about the finances of the Commander-in-Chief, President Biden has released the most tax returns of any president while in office,” the White House said, noting Biden has now shared 25 years of tax returns.\n\nAfter years of secrecy, six years of former President Donald Trump’s taxes, including those from his time in the White House, were later released to the public through the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nThey showed the former president paid very little in federal income taxes the first and last year of his presidency, claiming huge losses that helped limit his tax bill, among other revelations.",

In total, they earned $579,514 last year, with most of their income coming from the president's standard $400,000 salary.\n\nThey paid a combined $169,820 in federal and state income taxes, with payments to Delaware and Virginia, where the first lady works as an instructor at Northern Virginia Community College. She has maintained her day job while performing the duties of first lady. She made $82,335 for her teaching work, an increase from the year before.\n\nTheir effective federal tax rate came in at 23.8%. The Bidens contributed $20,180 to charitable causes including their home parish St. Joseph on the Brandywine in Wilmington, Del., and to the Beau Biden Foundation. That charity, which works to ensure children are free from threat and abuse, got their largest gift, $5,000. It was created to honor the president's late son, who died of a brain tumor in 2015.\n\nAccording to the White House, this marks 25 years of tax returns the Bidens have made public. Biden was vice president for eight of those years and released 22 years of returns during the 2020 campaign to draw contrast between himself and former president Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nAmerican presidents traditionally release their tax returns. But former President Donald Trump refused to do so. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee eventually made those filings public after a lengthy legal fight. The returns showed he paid very little in taxes after business losses.\n\nHarris and Emhoff had a lower tax rate\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff also released their returns, showing earnings of $456,918. Their effective federal tax rate was 20.5%, coming in lower than the Bidens. This is a steep drop in income from the more than $1.6 million they earned the year before, when Emhoff was a practicing lawyer.\n\nEmhoff, who like the first lady continues to have a day job, teaches at Georgetown University, where he earned $169,665 in 2022. The Vice President lists $219,171 in income from the Senate. As vice president, she also serves as president of the Senate.\n\nTheir charitable contributions, totaling $23,000, included contributions to DC Central Kitchen, the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, Third Baptist Church and Howard University, where the vice president attended college.",

They contributed $20,000 to charity.\n\nThe total is a massive decrease from last year when they registered a federal adjusted gross income of $1,655,563. In contrast, the taxes they paid in 2021 was greater than their income in 2022. The major contrast could be due to selling a residence, according to CNN.",

Those figures are lower compared to 2021, when the Bidens earned $610,702 with an effective federal income tax rate of 24.6 percent before taking office.\n\nThe annual salary of a president is $400,000 salary, which accounts for most of their income. First lady Jill Biden works as a professor at Northern Virginia Community College and made $82,335.\n\nThe president and first lady paid $169,820 in combined federal, Delaware, and Virginia income taxes. They pay $137,658 in federal income tax, $29,023 in Delaware income tax, and the first lady pays $3,139 in Virginia income tax as a result of her job in the commonwealth.\n\nThe Bidens donated $20,180 across 20 different charities, with the largest contribution a $5,000 gift to Beau Biden Foundation, which is the same amount they gave to the charity last year. The foundation, named after the president’s late son, focuses on protecting children from the threat of abuse.\n\nThey also donated to St. Joseph on the Brandywine, their parish in Wilmington, Del., to the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, and the National Fraternal Order of Police Foundation, according to the White House.\n\n“With this release, President Biden has shared a total of 25 years of tax returns with the American public. Once again demonstrating his commitment to being transparent with the American people about the finances of the Commander-in-Chief, President Biden has released the most tax returns of any president while in office,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, had a combined income of $456,918 in 2022, according to their tax returns released Tuesday. The documents show the second couple paid an effective federal income tax rate of 20.5 percent and paid $93,570 in federal income tax.\n\nThe combined income decreased significantly from 2021, when Harris and Emhoff had a combined income of $1,655,563 and paid an effective federal income tax rate of 31.6 percent. At the time, Emhoff earned $582,543 for his work as a lawyer at the law firms DLA Piper and Venable, which he left early in 2021 when Harris was sworn in as vice president.\n\nThe couple paid $17,612 in California income tax, Emhoff paid $9,697 in District of Columbia income tax for his work teaching at Georgetown University, and they contributed $23,000 to charity in 2022.",

                    "snippet": "Clarence Thomas, in other words, may have broken the law.\n\nIf so, then penalties for either falsifying or “knowingly or willfully” failing to file or report required information include fines of as much as $71,316 per omission and, potentially, a criminal referral. In 2015, for example, as CNN reported, “a financial administrator for the Federal Bureau of Prisons was given three years probation and paid a $5,000 fine for failing to disclose a business relationship he had with a federal contractor that was competing to provide inmate health care services.”\n\nThe idea that Thomas will face any penalty, much less an official investigation by the Supreme Court, is obviously wish-casting. The politics of the court, the lack of any internal check on the court’s members and the general unwillingness of Congress to challenge the court’s power — or even scrutinize its affairs — mean Thomas can act with relative impunity.\n\nAnd even if he couldn’t, even if there were meaningful and politically feasible consequences for misconduct among members of the Supreme Court — impeachment is practically a dead letter — there’s the fact that the law is simply more forgiving of the rich and the powerful.\n\nIf Thomas were an ordinary federal employee — or even an ordinary federal judge — he would probably have to answer to authorities for his failure to disclose income from a real estate sale for nearly a decade. As it stands, it is apparently enough for him to amend the form in question, as he did in 2011 after he failed to report the more than $686,000 his wife, Ginni Thomas, earned from the Heritage Foundation between 2003 and 2007. When asked to report his spouse’s income, Thomas had checked the box labeled “none.” (Thomas has in fact let it be known that he intends to amend his disclosure forms to account for the 2014 real estate transaction.)\n\nIt is apparently no harm and no foul for a justice of the Supreme Court to show willful and repeated indifference to disclosure requirements under the law.",

Those banks include Bank of America, Cathay Bank, JPMorgan Chase, and HSBC USA N.A. The four banks have since complied with Comer’s subpoenas and delivered the requested information to the committee for review.\n\nThe Kentucky congressman has pledged to follow the money to ascertain whether Joe Biden was compromised by his family’s influence peddling with foreign advisories.\n\n“This information leads to more information that we are going to continue to request,” Comer told Fox Business on Monday. “There will be more subpoenas.”\n\nComer has not disclosed if he has or has not subpoenaed any of the Biden family members.\n\n🚨NEW🚨 Financial records related to the Biden family were made available to @GOPoversight. We’ve now identified 6 additional members of Joe Biden’s family who may have benefited from shady deals. This brings our total to 9. We will provide more details soon. @larry_kudlow pic.twitter.com/DhsnBfvyiv — Rep. James Comer (@RepJamesComer) April 17, 2023\n\n“This is going to get to a point very soon where the mainstream media, as well as the [Attorney General] Merrick Garland, cannot continue to turn a blind eye to this. It’s strange. It’s illegal,” Comer said. “There’s no laws that allow family members to profit from a high-ranking government official to the tune of what this family has done.”\n\nOn Monday, Comer revealed a total of nine Biden family members may have profited from the family’s international business schemes, six more than previously disclosed.\n\n“We’ve identified six additional members of Joe Biden’s family who may have benefited from the Biden family’s businesses that we are investigating, bringing the total number of those involved or benefiting to nine,” Comer said in a statement.\n\nThrough the Biden family’s suspicious activity reports (SARs) held at the U.S. Treasury, Comer uncovered in March that a top Biden associate received a $3 million wire transfer from a Chinese energy company, CEFC. In turn, four Biden family members — Hunter, James, Hallie Biden, and an unidentified “Biden” — received a collective $1.3 million cut from the $3 million wire transfer.\n\nWATCH: White House Spox DODGES Question About Chinese Payments to Biden Family: “I’m Just Not Going to Even Respond”:\n\nThe White House / YouTube\n\nComer believes Biden family members received the $1.3 million in return for favors from President Joe Biden. “We believe the reason the family was receiving this money is because of favors that Joe Biden did as vice president and or as president,” Comer told Bloomberg in March.\n\nHunter has confirmed the $1.3 million China payout, while Joe Biden falsely denied it.\n\n“That’s not true,” Joe Biden told reporters.\n\nIn 2018 and 2020, Breitbart Senior Contributor and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer published Secret Empires and Profiles in Corruption. Each book hit #1 on the New York Times bestseller list and exposed how Hunter Biden and Joe Biden flew aboard Air Force Two in 2013 to China before Hunter’s firm inked a $1.5 billion deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government’s Bank of China less than two weeks after the trip. Schweizer’s work also uncovered the Biden family’s other vast and lucrative foreign deals and cronyism. Breitbart Political Editor Emma-Jo Morris’s investigative work at the New York Post on the Hunter Biden “laptop from hell” also captured international headlines when she, along with Miranda Devine, revealed that Joe Biden was intimately involved in Hunter’s businesses, appearing to even have a ten percent stake in a company the scion formed with officials at the highest levels of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nFollow Wendell Husebø on Twitter @WendellHusebø.

                    "snippet": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday signed an executive order in the Rose Garden that issues more than 50 directives across nearly every Cabinet-level agency in an effort to expand access to long-term care and child care.\n\nBiden, flanked by child care and family care advocates and providers, called the executive order “the most comprehensive set of actions any administration has taken to date to increase access to high quality child care and long-term care and support for the caregivers.”\n\nThe president said the order “doesn’t require any new spending” and that it will ensure “taxpayers will get the best value for the investments they’ve already made.”\n\n“In the pandemic, we made it even clearer just how hard it is for millions of working- and middle-class families to provide care for their families,” Biden said. “It’s not just how important the care economy is to the entire economy, it’s when people have to leave the labor force or can’t enter it in the first place because of caregiving responsibility, they can’t fully participate in the economy, and that drags down the whole nation’s productivity and growth overall.”\n\nTuesday’s order aims to expand and guarantee access to affordable child care for families, including military families, according to the White House. Per a fact sheet shared with CNN ahead of the announcement, the White House is directing federal agencies to “identify which of their grant programs can support child care and long-term care for individuals working on federal projects, and consider requiring applicants seeking federal job-creating funds to expand access to care for their workers,” as well as directing the Department of Defense to take steps to improve the affordability of child care on military installations.\n\nThe order directs the Office of Personnel Management to conduct a review of child care subsidy policy and consider setting government-wide standards for federal government employees to access such assistance. Expanded access, according to the order, could come “through federal child care centers, child care subsidies, or contracted care for providers.”\n\nDomestic Policy Adviser Susan Rice called the move “historic” during a call with reporters previewing the executive order, though any additional funding for such efforts would face an unlikely road in Congress.\n\n“Child care and long-term care systems in this country just don’t work well – high quality care is costly to deliver, it’s labor intensive, it requires skilled workers,” Rice said. “Yet care workers – who are disproportionately women and women of color and immigrants – are among the lowest paid in the country, despite working in some of the most important and complex and demanding jobs. At the same time, the price of care represents an outside share of family’s budget, with child care prices up 26% in just the last decade and long-term care costs up nearly 40%.”\n\nAdditional steps outlined in the executive order would seek to improve working conditions for early educators, long-term care workers and child care workers, with the order instructing the department of Health and Human Services to increase pay and benefits for Head Start employees, issue regulations to ensure Medicaid funding for long-term and home care workers caring for Medicaid enrollees and testing a new dementia care model that would include support for respite care under Medicare.\n\nThe Department of Labor will also publish a sample employment agreement “so domestic childcare and long-term care workers and their employers can ensure both parties better understand their rights and responsibilities.”\n\nStill, one administration official acknowledged that any additional funding for long-term care and child care programs would face steep headwinds in a divided Congress, noting that while the president included “a robust, holistic care agenda” in his proposed budget, it faces challenges so long as Republicans control the US House of Representatives.\n\n“This is a case where the president is working hard on the investment angle – has worked hard with Congress – but that avenue has not worked out as well,” the official said Monday.",

                    "snippet": "Councils lavish six-figure salaries on 2,759 bosses despite cost of living crisis\n\nThousands of \"fat cat\" town hall chiefs pocketed more than £100,000 last year – as the public struggled with spiralling council tax bills. A staggering 721 officials made more than £150,000 and 19 received in excess of £250,000.\n\nIt comes as families ­prepare for an average rise of £100 a year on their council tax bills from this month. Overall, at least 2,759 town hall bureaucrats got at least £100,000 each last year. And pay for 165 council bosses even topped the £164,951 that Rishi Sunak is entitled to claim as the Prime Minister. At least two pay and perks packages were worth more than £500,000, according to a report by the TaxPayers’ Alliance.\n\nGuildford Borough Council\n\nJohn O’Connell, the chief executive of the organisation, said: “Taxpayers facing record council tax rises want to be sure they are getting value for money from their local authority leadership. Many authorities continue with generous pay and perks, while local people are facing a financial squeeze. Residents can use these figures to hold their town hall bosses to account.” The scale of local authority spending was revealed with millions struggling as the cost-of-living crisis continues to bite. According to the TPA’s latest “rich list”, the largest remuneration package paid out in 2021/22 was to James Whiteman, the former chief executive at Guildford Borough Council, who got £607,633. This allegedly included pension contributions of £339,158, some £154,240 compensation for loss of office, a salary of £107,195 and £5,688 in benefits, the report claimed. Guildford Borough Council was asked to confirm if the huge remuneration package was paid to Mr Whiteman.\n\nREAD MORE Map shows which regions at greatest risk of losing all council housing A spokesman said: “In the last financial year we made a one-off payment of £154,000 to the former managing director. The payment was a legal obligation and reflects over 30 years of loyal service to our borough. “This payment was shared equally with Waverley Borough Council in line with our partnership agreement.\n\n“GBC also paid £339,000 into the Surrey local government pension scheme. The fund supports all members of that scheme. We made the payment from a capital receipt,\n\nunder the flexible use of capital receipt government scheme, so this has no impact on the services we provide.” Next on the list was Sunderland City Council’s executive director of neighbourhoods Fiona Brown, who the report said got £573,550. Robert Steenson, North Lanarkshire’s former executive director of enterprise and communities, received £536,530, it was said. Sandy Hopkins, the former chief executive of Southampton Council, got £406,403, while Paul Najsarek, formerly of Ealing Council, was paid £325,047, according to the TPA. The authority with the greatest number of employees taking home six-figure packages was Westminster with 50, the report said.\n\nA spokesman for the Local Government Association said: “Councils are large, complex organisations with sizeable budgets. “It is important that the right people with the right skills and experience are retained to deliver this important work. “Senior pay is always decided by democratically elected councillors in an open and transparent way.” The Government has increased the amount that authorities in England are allowed to put up ­council tax without having to hold\n\na local referendum, with most pushing ahead with the maximum five percent rise. In England, if you pay the average Band D tax of £1,966 a year, that would mean an extra £98.",

                    "snippet": "The House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on Tuesday morning to talk about President Joe Biden’s policy of importing hundreds of thousands of indebted foreign teenagers to take jobs that would otherwise go to better-paid young Americans.\n\nThe main witness is Christi Grimm, the Inspector General at Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services. For more than ten years, the agency has been delivering the so-called “Unaccompanied Alien Children” to labor traffickers nationwide.\n\nThe hearing will be chaired by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) and by Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA), who runs the committee’s panel on oversight and investigations.\n\nRepublicans will likely focus blame for the scandal on Biden’s deputies at the Department of Health and Human Services. They will likely downplay employers’ preference for hiring disposable and cheap migrant workers instead of hiring Americans or investing in labor-saving machines.\n\nSo far, Republicans have declined to seek political advantage from the teenage-worker scandal, likely because many companies have benefited from the federal government’s long-standing role in the labor-trafficking racket. This silence has helped Democrats dodge any political fallout from potential public opposition to Biden’s imported workforce of indentured, indebted teenage workers.\n\nWatch here, starting at 10.30 AM:\n\nThe scandal was made undeniable by detailed articles in the New York Times, including an April 17 article that said:\n\nAgain and again, veteran government staffers and outside contractors told the Health and Human Services Department, including in reports that reached Secretary Xavier Becerra, that children appeared to be at risk. The Labor Department put out news releases noting an increase in child labor. Senior White House aides were shown evidence of exploitation, such as clusters of migrant children who had been found working with industrial equipment or caustic chemicals. … One [migrant], Marvin Che, said he came to the United States last year, when he was 16, and had been working 12-hour overnight shifts alongside other migrant children packing products at the manufacturer Pactiv Evergreen, including Hefty plastic party cups. “We came alone, so we have to work hard,” Marvin said. … [In Florida,] a boy working construction said he felt ashamed about not knowing how to read. He, too, was released in 2021 — at age 12 — and was immediately put to work by a man who had sponsored at least five children. At a day-labor pickup site, a 13-year-old released last year to a man he had never met said he wished he could enroll in middle school and start learning English. “People don’t know,” Antonio said, “but there are a lot of kids here living the same life.”\n\nA briefing prepared for the hearing by GOP staffers said:\n\nThe number of unaccompanied children referred to ORR has ballooned from 15,381 in fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 122,731 in FY2021 and 128,904 in FY2022. Even as the numbers of unaccompanied children were skyrocketing, HHS’ capacity to care for these children diminished. To cope with the influx of unaccompanied children, ORR opened Emergency Intake Sites (EIS) in early 2021. However, HHS OIG reports doubt the efficiency and competency of case managers at EIS facilities, as well as the general health and well-being of the children housed at these locations. OIG found children have experienced emotional distress and instances of self-harm. Due to overcrowding, unaccompanied children are now released to sponsors without sufficient vetting procedures. As a result, these children are vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation. There are also concerns about ORR’s ability to track released children—according to recent findings, over the last two years, HHS has “lost immediate contact with a third of migrant children” and “could not reach more than 85,000 children” one month after they were placed with an adult.”\n\n“We’re complicit as a nation in human trafficking,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said at a March 2021 press conference in Texas with 17 other GOP Senators.",

                    "snippet": "Fox News Network and Dominion Voting Systems today reached a $787.5 million settlement, ending a trial in Dominion's defamation lawsuit against Fox just before opening arguments would have been heard.\n\n\"Over two years ago, a torrent of lies swept Dominion and election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories, causing grievous harm,\" Dominion attorney Justin Nelson said in a press conference today, according to CNN.\n\nNelson revealed the $787.5 million settlement figure during the press conference. He said the deal provides \"vindication and accountability,\" showing that \"the truth matters, lies have consequences.\"\n\nThe trial was originally scheduled to begin in Delaware Superior Court yesterday, but the start was delayed one day because the sides were holding settlement talks. A 12-person jury was selected Tuesday, and opening statements were slated for this afternoon. But there was another delay, which was followed by the settlement announcement.\n\n\"We acknowledge the court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,\" Fox said in a statement, according to Reuters. \"This settlement reflects Fox's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.\"\n\nFox News apparently won't have to apologize on air. \"Under the terms of the settlement, Fox News will not have to apologize or admit to spreading false claims on network programming, according to a person familiar with the details of the agreement,\" The New York Times wrote.\n\nJudge ruled Fox News aired false statements\n\nOn March 31, Judge Eric Davis ruled that Fox News aired false statements about Dominion related to the 2020 presidential election. These statements were defamatory per se because they \"claimed that Dominion committed election fraud; manipulated vote counts through its software and algorithms; is founded in Venezuela to rig elections for dictator Hugo Chavez; and paid kickbacks to government officials who used the machines in the Election,\" he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While the Court must view the record in the light most favorable to Fox, the record does not show a genuine issue of material fact as to falsity,\" Davis wrote. Davis said it was \"crystal clear\" that none of the Fox News statements challenged by Dominion were true. \"Therefore, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of Dominion on the element of falsity,\" he wrote.\n\nIf the trial had gone forward, jurors would have had to decide whether Fox News acted with actual malice. If Dominion won, jurors would have had to calculate damages to be awarded to Dominion, which asked for $1.6 billion.\n\nDavis announced the settlement in court shortly before 4 pm ET, CNBC wrote. \"Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation,\" Davis reportedly told jurors. \"Although it's short, not the six weeks you've expected, you have done your duty.\"\n\nWe contacted Fox News and Dominion today and will update this article if we get additional information on the settlement terms.\n\nDominion separately sued Newsmax and One America News Network. Voting machine maker Smartmatic also sued all three networks.\n\nSmartmatic attorney J. Erik Connolly reportedly issued a statement saying that \"Dominion's litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox's disinformation campaign,\" and \"Smartmatic will expose the rest. Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy.\"\n\nNewsmax provided a statement saying it \"believes that the facts at issue in Dominion's case against it are materially different from those that may have driven Fox to settle, and no conclusion about Newsmax should be drawn from that settlement. Newsmax stands by its coverage and analysis of the 2020 election and will continue to vigorously defend against the claim.\"",

Dominion had sought $1.6 billion in damages in the lawsuit filed in 2021.\n\nDominion CEO John Poulos called the settlement \"historic.\"\n\n\"Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees and our customers,\" Poulos said in a statement.\n\n\"Truthful reporting in the media is essential to our democracy,\" Poulos said.\n\nAt issue in the lawsuit was whether Fox was liable for airing the false claims that Denver-based Dominion's ballot-counting machines were used to manipulate the presidential election in favor of Democrat Joe Biden over then-President Donald Trump, a Republican.\n\nTuesday's settlement spared Fox the peril of having some of its best-known figures called to the witness stand and subjected to potentially withering questioning, including executives such as Rupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old who serves as Fox Corp chairman, as well as on-air hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro.\n\nFox anchor Neil Cavuto broke into his news show \"Your World\" about 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to report the settlement. A statement by Fox was read on air.\n\n\"We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems,\" the statement said. \"We acknowledge the Court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.\"\n\nFOX HAS BILLIONS IN CASH\n\nShares of Fox Corp closed up slightly at $34 per share, but were down 1% in after-hours trading following disclosure of the settlement amount. Fox has cash on hand to pay for a settlement. It committed $3 billion to buy back shares in the first quarter after revenues beat estimates. Fox Corp CEO Lachlan Murdoch told Wall Street analysts in February that the company had about $4 billion cash on hand.\n\nDominion lawyers declined to answer questions about whether Fox News would apologize publicly or make changes.\n\n[1/5] Dominion CEO John Poulos and lawyers speak to the media after Dominion Voting Systems and Fox settled a defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million, avoiding trial, over Fox's coverage of debunked election-rigging claims, in Delaware Superior Court, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. April 18, 2023. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz 1 2 3 4 5\n\nFox News is the most-watched U.S. cable news network.\n\nThe settlement of $787.5 million is the largest amount of money paid to conclude an American media libel case, said Richard Tofel, principal of Gallatin Advisory. The previously highest payment occurred in 2017 when Walt Disney Co paid $177 million, in addition to insurance recoveries, to settle the \"pink slime\" defamation case against its ABC network by Beef Products Inc.\n\nDominion sued Fox Corp and Fox News, contending that its business was ruined by the false vote-rigging claims that were aired by the news outlet known for its roster of conservative commentators. The trial was to have tested whether Fox's coverage crossed the line between ethical journalism and the pursuit of ratings, as Dominion alleged and Fox denied. Fox had portrayed itself in the pretrial skirmishing as a defender of press freedom.\n\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis, presiding over the case, had ordered a one-day trial postponement on Monday. Fox was pursuing settlement talks, two sources familiar with the matter said. Davis delayed the trial on Tuesday, as the two sides appeared to hammer out the deal in private.\n\nThe primary question for jurors was to be whether Fox knowingly spread false information or recklessly disregarded the truth, the standard of \"actual malice\" that Dominion must show to prevail in a defamation case.\n\nIn February court filings, Dominion cited a trove of internal communications in which Murdoch and other Fox figures privately acknowledged that the vote-rigging claims made about Dominion on-air were false. Dominion said Fox amplified the untrue claims to boost its ratings and prevent its viewers from migrating to other media competitors on the right.\n\nANOTHER LAWSUIT PENDING\n\nAdding to the legal risks for Fox, another U.S. voting technology company, Smartmatic, is pursuing its own defamation lawsuit seeking $2.7 billion in damages in a New York state court.\n\n\"For many plaintiffs, a court holding, and admission by the defendant about falsity, are even more important than any actual money damages,\" said Mary-Rose Papandrea, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law.\n\nFox had earlier argued that claims by Trump and his lawyers about the election were inherently newsworthy and protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. Davis ruled in March that Fox could not use those arguments as a defense, finding its coverage was false, defamatory and not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nThe lawsuit referenced instances in which Trump allies including his former lawyers Rudolph Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on Fox News to advance the false allegations.\n\nMurdoch internally described the election-rigging claims as \"really crazy\" and \"damaging\" but declined to wield his editorial power to stop them and conceded under oath that some Fox hosts nonetheless \"endorsed\" the baseless claims, Dominion told the court in a filing.\n\nUnder questioning from a Dominion lawyer, Murdoch testified that he thought everything about the election was on the \"up-and-up\" and doubted the rigging claims from the very beginning, according to Dominion's filing.\n\nAsked if he could have intervened to stop Giuliani from continuing to spread falsehoods on air, Murdoch responded, \"I could have. But I didn't,\" the filing said.\n\nReporting by Helen Coster in Wilmington and Jack Queen in New York; Editing by Will Dunham\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                    "snippet": "Listen 9 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. — Fox News agreed Tuesday to pay $787.5 million to Dominion Voting Systems, settling a lawsuit brought by a company that was repeatedly smeared on air with fantastical claims of helping to rig a presidential election and marking an abrupt end to one of the most consequential and closely watched media cases in decades.\n\nThe eye-popping figure — the largest publicly disclosed monetary settlement ever in an American defamation action — averted what could have been an even costlier outcome for Fox and its parent company, Fox Corp., had the suit gone to a jury. Dominion had sought $1.6 billion, and several pretrial rulings had strengthened its claims.\n\nThe settlement agreement came with only a grudging acknowledgment by Fox that it had been wrong in repeatedly airing false statements that backed up President Donald Trump’s bogus claims of election fraud after the 2020 election. Fox’s hosts and guests had repeatedly depicted Dominion, the maker of voting machines and software, as at the heart of a conspiracy to change votes to hand Joe Biden the election.\n\nJustin Nelson, an attorney for Dominion, celebrated the team's settlement on April 18 in the defamation case against Fox News. (Video: Reuters)\n\n“We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” the cable network said in a statement following the news that it would no longer contest Dominion’s allegations in court. “This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe parties came to a last-minute deal that was announced just after a jury was selected to hear the case and just before opening arguments were slated to begin in a superior court in Delaware — Biden’s home state.\n\n“The truth has meaning,” said a lawyer for Dominion, Justin Nelson, in remarks delivered outside the courthouse. “Lies have consequences.” The settlement agreement, he added, “represents a ringing endorsement for truth and democracy.”\n\nThe settlement ends a humiliating chapter for Fox and its chairman, Rupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old billionaire media mogul. Through pretrial discovery that resulted in the release of hundreds of thousands of pages of emails, texts and other communications, Dominion showed that Murdoch, as well as Fox’s executives and producers, were aware that Trump’s claims of election sabotage were suspect, but permitted hosts and guests to perpetuate them to keep viewers from switching to other channels.\n\nMurdoch, who was expected to testify at the trial, said in a deposition that he didn’t believe Trump’s claims but decided not to intervene as Fox hosts such as Sean Hannity, Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro repeatedly bashed Dominion.\n\nDominion was prepared to show that Fox feared the defection of viewers, despite knowing it was airing falsehoods, subjecting the network to a public-relations beating during a trial that had been expected to last six weeks. Murdoch evidently calculated that settling with Dominion would be far less expensive, from both a reputational and a monetary perspective, than taking the gamble of a trial and an adverse jury verdict, which could have exceeded Dominion’s own damage claim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs is, the $787.5 million settlement may be the largest ever in a defamation case, although it’s difficult to know for certain because settlements are often confidential.\n\n“Fox News must have been terrified to face a jury with the evidence,” said defamation attorney Charles Harder, who previously represented Trump and pro wrestler Hulk Hogan in libel and invasion-of-privacy actions against media companies.\n\nThe settlement was cheered by some First Amendment advocates, who argued that Fox’s actions had gone beyond those typically protected by the high bar courts have traditionally set to prove defamation. Katie Fallow, senior counsel at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said that “the evidence gathered by Dominion suggests that Fox News crossed the line from simply reporting on the ‘Big Lie’ to knowingly spreading misinformation. This is the rare case where imposing financial liability on a media outlet for publishing false statements seems to be justified.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe settlement does not require Fox to issue an on-air correction or apology, according to two people close to the network. Instead, the company’s statement was read on Fox’s airwaves Tuesday by Fox media reporter Howard Kurtz, who has covered the trial for the network and attended the court hearing in person. During an appearance Tuesday afternoon, Kurtz referred to the statements made on Fox in the weeks and months after the 2020 election as “obviously false” and “conspiracy theories.”\n\nAsked why Fox won’t have to apologize as part of the settlement deal, a Dominion spokeswoman said: “An apology is about accountability, and today Dominion held Fox accountable. Fox paid a historic settlement and issued a statement acknowledging that the statements about Dominion were false.”\n\nThe end of the dispute with Dominion doesn’t end Fox’s legal troubles stemming from the 2020 election. It still faces a defamation suit from another voting-tech company, Smartmatic, which is seeking $2.7 billion in damages. Settling the Dominion case could raise the possibility of a settlement with Smartmatic, which has made claims similar to Dominion’s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe settlement with Dominion was characteristic of Murdoch and Fox, which have a history of burying alleged misconduct with payments before a dispute reaches trial. Before Dominion, the known cumulative amount of its settlements over the past 13 years had approached three-quarters of a billion dollars.\n\nOther Murdoch-run subsidiaries paid more than $100 million in 2011 and 2012 to celebrities and crime victims whose phone messages were hacked by his British tabloids. Fox paid $50 million in 2016 to women who alleged sexual harassment by Fox News co-founder Roger Ailes and then-host Bill O’Reilly.\n\nThe Dominion settlement came after Delaware judge Eric M. Davis issued several pretrial rulings in March that significantly narrowed Fox’s avenues for defending its conduct.\n\nThe judge ruled, for instance, that the network could not dispute that it aired false, harmful statements about Dominion, though it could contest whether it did so with “actual malice” — that is, with knowledge that the statements were false or without regard to their truth or falsity. Plaintiffs must establish that a defendant acted with actual malice to prove a libel or defamation claim under a nearly 60-year-old standard established by the Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome legal scholars had called Davis’s ruling disastrous for Fox because it stripped away a key line of defense — that the network’s hosts were merely reporting and commenting on newsworthy claims. It would have forced Fox to defend a blizzard of false statements uttered by Hannity, Pirro, Bartiromo and former host Lou Dobbs.\n\nThe end of the Fox-Dominion dispute came after months of bitter rhetoric between the two parties and followed revelations that exposed the lengths to which Fox was willing to go to support Trump’s discredited claims that he was cheated out of a second term.\n\nThe network aired multiple interviews with Trump-associated lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell in which they made wild claims about Dominion’s software. Dobbs, Bartiromo and other hosts sometimes added supportive commentary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDominion showed through pretrial discovery of memos, texts and emails that Murdoch, Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott, and hosts such as Hannity and Tucker Carlson doubted Trump’s allegations and considered Giuliani and Powell unreliable. At one point, Carlson privately referred to Trump as “a demonic force” and wrote that he hated him “passionately.”\n\nBut the network kept pushing the conspiracy storyline, spooked by worries that viewers would abandon Fox and turn to far-right networks like Newsmax and One America News if Fox didn’t support Trump’s false claims. (Dominion has also sued Newsmax and OAN.) Scott, the CEO, appeared to be especially concerned, disparaging Fox journalists for the manner in which they combated the misinformation.\n\nThe settlement ends Fox’s aggressive efforts to rebut Dominion’s allegations. For months, its spokespeople accused Dominion of “cherry picking” statements from pretrial evidence to gin up anti-Fox headlines. The network repeatedly cited the First Amendment and said that if Dominion prevailed, the verdict would “prevent journalists from basic reporting” on newsworthy events.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also said Dominion’s proposed monetary damages, $1.6 billion, were grossly inflated by Dominion’s “opportunistic private equity owners” in light of the company’s revenue and valuation.\n\nThe “stolen election” narrative perpetuated by Trump and amplified by Fox eventually culminated in a mob attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress met to certify the electoral college results, though the judge had ruled that Dominion could not tell a jury that Fox’s broadcasts influenced the events of that day.\n\nFor Dominion, the settlement averts what probably would have been a lengthy legal fight even if it had won at trial. Fox’s legal advisers said they believed the network could have prevailed on appeal — a process that would probably have taken years and delayed any financial redress.\n\nThe $787.5 million price tag for Fox’s settlement with Dominion Voting Systems amounts to almost one-fifth of the company’s cash on hand, a sizable hit to the company’s bottom line, although it’s not clear if insurance will cover some of Fox’s liability. Fox Corp. chief executive Lachlan Murdoch told analysts in February during an earnings call that the company had about $4 billion in cash on hand.\n\nThe settlement was disclosed after the close of the stock market. In after-hours trading, Fox Corp. stock was down less than 1 percent.\n\nMarley reported from Wilmington, and Farhi and Izadi reported from Washington. Matthew Brown, Sarah Ellison, Rosalind S.

                    "snippet": "Tailed by a lone demonstrator, the legal team representing Fox News arrives at the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center where Fox News was being sued by Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nFox News avoided one of the highest-profile defamation trials in history Tuesday by reaching a $787.5-million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, the company that accused the conservative channel of smearing its reputation in the weeks after the 2020 election.\n\nThe extraordinary settlement — one of the largest financial settlements in a defamation case — came on the same day the trial began in Delaware Superior Court.\n\nThe jury would have determined whether Fox News acted with malice by deliberately airing false statements about the voting machine maker. Dominion was seeking $1.6 billion in damages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the monetary damages, the network in a statement also conceded that it had aired falsehoods about the Denver-based company.\n\n“We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” Fox News said in the statement.\n\nHowever, Fox News won’t have to apologize for spreading false claims, nor will its anchors be required to read any contrite statements or retractions on the air, according to a person familiar with the agreement who was not authorized to comment.\n\nJustin Nelson, an attorney for Dominion, said in remarks outside the courthouse that the staggering monetary settlement “represents vindication and accountability; lies have consequences.”\n\nNelson added: “The truth does not know red or blue. People across the political spectrum can and should disagree on issues even of the most profound importance. But for our democracy to endure for another 250 years and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts.”\n\nThe agreement was announced after a 12-person jury and 12 alternates were chosen in the court’s morning session. After a 90-minute lunch break that stretched into three hours, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis returned to the bench to say that “the parties have resolved the case.”\n\nMany legal analysts were surprised that the closely watched case had not been settled before trial, given the potential legal and reputational damage to Fox News.\n\nThe resolution means Fox News avoids a media spectacle at the Leonard Williams Justice Center in Wilmington, Del. More than 50 working journalists have been gathered for the trial with TV outlets stationed under tents outside the courthouse.\n\nThe conservative network’s biggest stars, including Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Maria Bartiromo, and top executives such as 92-year-old Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, had been expected to be called to the witness stand.\n\nFox News entered the court proceeding at a disadvantage. Davis ruled March 31 that on-air statements about Dominion made by network hosts and their guests were false.\n\nDavis also shot down Fox’s assertion that its reporting on false allegations was justified because they were made by former President Trump and were therefore newsworthy.\n\n“Just because someone is newsworthy doesn’t mean you can defame someone,” Davis said at an April 11 pretrial hearing.\n\nCourt filings in the case provided a glimpse into the inner workings of Fox News, with emails and texts showing how executives and hosts tried to balance their own disbelief of Trump’s allegations with their perceived need to mollify his supporters who habitually watch the network.\n\nDepositions depicted a highly decentralized operation where management often did little to control what its on-air talent said.\n\nDominion accused Fox News of amplifying false charges made by Trump’s attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudolph W. Giuliani that the company’s machines manipulated votes to help elect Joe Biden president.\n\nThere was no evidence of widespread voter fraud or any wrongful actions by Dominion. Claims to the contrary were fact-checked by some Fox News journalists and the network’s own research department, known as the “brain room.”\n\nDominion said Fox News acted out of fear that the MAGA faithful would tune out and move to upstart conservative network Newsmax, which was gaining viewership at the time.\n\nWhile media coverage of Dominion’s case was voluminous and largely negative for Fox News, it did little to damage the network’s standing with its audience. It remains the most-watched cable news network, well ahead of CNN and MSNBC, according to Nielsen data.\n\nHowever, the network’s standing in journalism circles has been diminished by the scandal. The media industry will be watching to see if Murdoch makes any significant changes to Fox News management or its lineup of on-air talent in reaction to the public humiliation his company has experienced.\n\nSuch moves could take awhile as Fox News management is averse to the public perception that Murdoch is responding to outside pressure.\n\nCompany Town Murdoch has survived scandal after scandal. Will Dominion-Fox News lawsuit be different? The media mogul acknowledged that he could have stopped the parade of conspiracy theorists on Fox News from amplifying false claims by former President Trump and his surrogates that the election in 2020 was stolen.\n\nFox News also is facing a $2.7-billion defamation lawsuit by Smartmatic, the voting software company that Trump’s lawyers falsely accused of manipulating vote counts in the 2020 presidential election. Smartmatic has accused Fox News and three of its on-air hosts — Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs and Jeanine Pirro — of presenting disinformation on their programs.\n\nStuart Brotman, a journalism professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, said the settlement — far exceeding the $177 million paid to Beef Products Inc. by Walt Disney Co. in 2017 over an ABC News report — means Smartmatic is likely to see a substantial payday as well.\n\nFox News also faces a gender discrimination lawsuit from a fired producer, Abby Grossberg, who also claims she was coerced to give misleading answers in her deposition testimony for the Dominion case.\n\n“The settlement shows that they [Fox News] don’t have an appetite for having their people go on trial,” Brotman said. “They are going to be writing more checks.”\n\nFox News is no stranger to paying out settlements as a means to make legal problems and scandals go away.\n\nThe company paid $20 million in 2017 to former anchor Gretchen Carlson, whose sexual harassment lawsuit against founding Fox News chief Roger Ailes was among the most high-profile in the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe network went on to pay millions in settlements to other women who brought harassment allegations.\n\nA $15-million payout went to former Fox News personality Melissa Francis in 2022 after she filed a gender-based pay-disparity claim against the company.\n\nFox News also paid millions to the family of Seth Rich, a 27-year-old Democratic National Committee employee, after the network’s website published unsubstantiated stories that his 2016 murder was tied to the leak of Hillary Clinton’s emails.\n\nFox has sufficient reserves to pay the Dominion settlement, with $4 billion in cash on hand, according to the company’s recent securities filings.\n\nFox referenced the Dominion and Smartmatic litigation in its last quarterly report, noting the company would “vigorously” defend itself against the claims of defamation, “including through any appeals.”\n\nSince that filing, Fox has lost a series of court motions. But the company noted that it had the financial strength to weather the storm.\n\n“The Company does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.”\n\nTimes staff writer Meg James in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",

But after the jury was sworn in and had a lunch recess, there was an unexplained two-hour delay waiting for the opening arguments to start. Shortly before 4 p.m. ET, the judge brought in the jury to announce that both parties had reached a settlement.\n\n“The parties have resolved their case,” Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis told the jurors before dismissing them. The terms of the settlement remain unknown as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn a statement sent to the New York Times after the settlement was announced, Fox Corporation said that it was “pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nOutside the courtroom, Dominion’s lawyer, Justin Nelson, added that “the truth matters,” and stated that the settlement with Fox was for $787.5 million. “Lies have consequences,” he said.\n\nIn this case, Dominion was seeking $1.6 billion in compensatory damages in the lawsuit against Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corporation, which was filed in March 2021.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Dominion alleged that Fox News hosts and executives promoted and broadcasted false claims and conspiracy theories that Dominion voting machines had rigged the 2020 election in favor of President Joe Biden. The theory had been widely promoted by former president Donald Trump .\n\nIn the complaint , lawyers for Dominion alleged that Fox hosts and executives knew that the claims made about the voting machines were untrue, and argued that Fox “sold a false story of election fraud in order to serve its own commercial purposes, severely injuring Dominion in the process.” Judge Davis had already ruled in a pretrial hearing that the statements made about Dominion’s voting machines relating to the 2020 election were false, meaning Dominion’s lawyers would have been tasked simply with proving Fox knew the statements were false or that the company acted with a “reckless disregard” for whether the claims were true or false.\n\nIn the complaint against Fox, Dominion alleged that even after Fox was “confronted with the direct facts disproving its lies about Dominion,” the company “refused to retract its false and defamatory statements, thereby further demonstrating its actual malice in publishing them.”\n\n“The truth matters,” Dominion’s complaint said. “Lies have consequences.”",

The settlement, which came after a 12-member jury had been seated in the case in Delaware Superior Court, averted a weekslong trial that could have seen top Fox TV hosts and network boss Rupert Murdoch publicly testify. The deal, which will cost Fox nearly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion originally demanded, was struck as opening arguments were delayed for hours amid speculation that the parties were discussing a resolution of the case.\n\nDominion CEO John Poulos, joined by members of the Dominion Voting Systems legal team, speaks to members of the media outside the Leonard Williams Justice Center in Wilmington, Delaware, on April 18, 2023. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty Images\n\nDominion CEO John Poulos told reporters outside court that the settlement was \"historic.\" \"Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees and the customers that we serve,\" Poulus said. \"Nothing can ever make up for that. Throughout this process we have sought accountability and believed the evidence brought to light through this case underscored the consequences of spreading lies. Truthful reporting in the media is essential to our democracy,\" he said. Superior Court Judge Eric Davis called the jury and 12 alternate jurors into the courtroom shortly before 4 p.m. ET to announce that they would not have to hear any testimony or review any evidence. \"The parties have resolved this case,\" Davis told them. \"Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation ... although it's short, not the six weeks you've expected, you have done your duty,\" the judge said.\n\nJustin Nelson (2R), joined by fellow members of the Dominion Voting Systems legal team, depart the Leonard Williams Justice Center in Wilmington, Delaware, on April 18, 2023.

We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.\" Fox's on-air talent won't have to acknowledge or say anything regarding the settlement on air, according to people familiar with the matter. A Dominion spokesperson said Tuesday: \"An apology is about accountability, and today Dominion held Fox accountable. Fox paid a historic settlement and issued a statement acknowledging that the statements about Dominion were false.\" The suit by Dominion, which sells voting machines and election software, had argued that Fox News and its sister network Fox Business \"intentionally and falsely\" blamed Dominion for the 2020 loss of former President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden by airing unsubstantiated claims about the company. Fox had said in court filings that its hosts' statements about Dominion were protected by the First Amendment. The company also said Dominion had not shown that the statements were made with so-called actual malice, which is the threshold for civil defamation claims. Lawyers for Fox said nothing when asked for comment as they left court Tuesday. The settlement avoids, for the moment, the risk of Murdoch and Fox hosts facing hostile questioning in public over the claims made about Dominion on the conservative news networks after the 2020 election. The planned witnesses in the case had included Tucker Carlson, Maria Bartiromo, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Jeanine Pirro. Also slated to testify was Lou Dobbs, whose Fox Business show was canceled in 2021.\n\nFox lawyers depart after Dominion Voting Systems and Fox settled the defamation lawsuit over Fox's coverage of debunked election-rigging claims, in Wilmington, Delaware, April 18, 2023.

But this shows that there is accountability, that we showed that if you are caught lying, you will be held responsible,” he said.\n\nAbsent from the settlement details shared with the public was an apology or any admission that the network had indeed defamed Dominion when it allowed baseless conspiracies to proliferate on air about the company's voting machines \"rigging\" 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump. A statement from Fox about the agreement recognized the court's previous ruling that the claims Dominion had challenged in its defamation lawsuit were indeed without merit.\n\n\"We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,\" the Fox statement said. “This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nWhen pressed, a spokesperson for Dominion said “an apology is about accountability, and today Dominion held Fox accountable.”\n\nStephen Shackelford Jr., the attorney who had been expected to give opening statements for Dominion on Tuesday, said “money is accountability.\"\n\nRumors of settlement talks had been buzzing for days, particularly after the court said late Sunday it would delay the conclusion of jury selection and opening arguments to Tuesday morning.\n\nThe News Corp. building in New York. Michael Nagle / Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nThe deal ends a monthslong legal battle over whether the media company had defamed the voting machine maker when Fox broadcast election conspiracy theories in 2020. The resolution came in the eleventh hour, after the jury was in place and reporters and lawyers had waited for hours for opening statements to begin.\n\n\"The parties have resolved their case,\" Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said Tuesday afternoon, informing the jurors of the settlement. \"That means your service is done and I’m going to excuse you. Sorry about making you wait.\"\n\nDominion sued Fox News in 2021, demanding $1.6 billion in damages. It said the network defamed it when it broadcast baseless claims that it was tied to the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, that it paid kickbacks to politicians and that its machines “rigged” the 2020 presidential election by flipping millions of votes for Trump to Joe Biden.\n\nThe settlement came after a bruising week for Fox News. During pretrial conference hearings, Davis sanctioned the network for withholding evidence, and admonished it for not being straightforward with him. He said he would allow Dominion to conduct an additional deposition with Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch at Fox’s expense. Davis also ruled that Fox lawyers could not use newsworthiness as a legal defense, limiting their possible trial strategies.\n\nOn Tuesday, Davis also appointed a special master to investigate whether Fox had adequately complied with court-ordered discovery. That probe was ended by the settlement, too.\n\nFew defamation suits make it this far, but outside legal experts say the case — and the extraordinary claims and evidence fueling it — was unique.\n\nThe settlement is a strong outcome for Dominion, those experts said, which won't have to wait years for a potential jury-awarded payout stuck in the appeals process.\n\nNot all settlement terms are disclosed, but experts say they believe Fox's payout to be among the biggest.\n\n\"This number is not small,\" said RonNell Andersen Jones, a professor at the University of Utah College of Law who specializes in the First Amendment. “It might be the biggest of its kind in history.\"\n\nJuries are always a risk, especially in a politically divisive case, she added.\n\n\"While going to a jury based on 'presumed damages' and malice often results in tremendous damages, it’s still a crapshoot,\" Anthony Michael Glassman, a longtime media lawyer who has represented both news outlets and the subjects of stories, said in an email.\n\nA hefty settlement without a trial \"is the right way to go,\" he added.",

                    "snippet": "Fox News has agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems a $787 million settlement, avoiding a trial in the $1.6 billion defamation case the electronic voting company brought against the cable news company.\n\nDominion brought a $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News and parent company Fox Corporation in March 2021 for defamation, accusing the news outlet of harming its reputation by airing former President Donald Trump and his attorneys’ claims that Dominion’s voting machines were used to rig the 2020 election.\n\nFox News has argued that Trump and his attorneys’ claims were newsworthy and protected by the First Amendment’s right of freedom of the press. However, Dominion accused Fox News and its executives of airing such claims to save their falling ratings after the 2020 election.\n\nThe parties settled on the first day of the trial, which was scheduled to start Tuesday after a 24-hour delay.\n\nAfter Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis swore in the 12 jurors and alternates on Tuesday morning, court proceedings were delayed for nearly two and a half hours as attorneys for both sides engaged in last-minute negotiations.\n\nThe trial was set to start at 1:30 p.m., but Davis took the bench shortly before 4:00 p.m. and announced the parties had settled.\n\n“The case has been resolved and it’s been resolved because of you,” Davis told the jurors.\n\n“Your presence here… was extremely important. And without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation,” Davis added.\n\nTuesday’s settlement avoids what was expected to be a six-week trial, which means Fox News executives and hosts like Rupert Murdoch, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and other potential witnesses will not have to testify before a jury about the network’s coverage of the 2020 election.\n\nThe trial would have featured more than 12,000 exhibits, as Dominion’s and Fox’s attorneys reportedly indicated there would be more than 7,000 and over 5,000 exhibits, respectively.\n\nLast week, Davis sanctioned Fox News, said the outlet had a “credibility problem,” and criticized its attorneys for not being “straightforward” with the court after it was revealed that Fox News withheld evidence from Dominion and may have made “misrepresentations to the court” about Murdoch’s role at Fox News.\n\nThe last-minute settlement includes a $787.5 million payment from Fox, Dominion attorney Justin Nelson announced.\n\n“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon. “Nothing can ever make up for that.”\n\n“I cannot thank the election officials that we serve enough. Without them, there is no democracy,” Poulos added.\n\nHowever, Dominion attorney Stephen Shackelford warned that the settlement with Fox is not the end of the company’s legal efforts to save its reputation.\n\n“We’re not done yet. We have some other people who have some accountability coming toward them,” Shackelford said.\n\nA Fox spokesperson said the company is “pleased” to settle the case and acknowledged the court’s findings that “certain claims about Dominion” were false.\n\nThe Fox spokesperson said:\n\nWe are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.\n\nFox Corporation had roughly $4.1 billion “of cash and cash equivalents” on hand at the end of 2022, the New York Times reported.\n\nFirst Amendment attorney Martin Garbus told the Times that “everybody wins” with Tuesday’s settlement.\n\n“With the settlement, everybody wins. Fox goes its way. Dominion gets cash,” Garbus said.\n\nFox is facing a similar defamation lawsuit against electronic voting firm Smartmatic, which sued the cable news company in February 2021 over fraud claims.\n\nJordan Dixon-Hamilton is a reporter for Breitbart News.

                    "snippet": "On Tuesday (April 18), Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit against it for a whopping $787.5 million after being sued for claiming that a voting machine company named Dominion helped ‘steal’ the 2020 US Presidential elections.\n\nAs per reports, the development came just before the opening statements were made in what was going to be a ‘blockbuster media trial.’ Dominion had initially sought $1.6 billion in damages from the American news network.\n\nFox News and Dominion later reached a settlement for half the ask at $787.5 million. In a statement, Fox News said, “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nThe American news network also stated that the $787.5 million settlement reflected its continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.\n\nFox News settles $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems, averts trialhttps://t.co/86DwXUF7nD pic.twitter.com/La1cyrTHZy — The Washington Times (@WashTimes) April 19, 2023\n\nFox News had reportedly claimed that Dominion switched votes during the 2020 US Presidential elections, paid kickbacks to the government, and was founded in Venezuela.\n\nThe voting machine company said that its business was harmed by the ‘false claims’ of Fox News. Even before the matter went to trial, Judge Eric Davis noted in an earlier ruling that the claims made by the news network were ‘not true.’\n\nHe had said, “The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election is true.”\n\nThe trial in Delaware against Fox News was meant to decide whether it committed ‘actual malice’ while accusing Dominion of rigging the election. It had earlier come to light that the top executives of the news network did not believe in the ‘election conspiracy’ claims that they aired on TV.\n\nLies have consequences, says the attorney for Dominion\n\nWhile speaking about the historic defamation suit settlement, Justin Nelson (the attorney for Dominion) said, “Lies have consequences.”\n\nHe added, “Over two years ago a torrent of lies swept Dominion and election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories, causing grievous harm to Dominion and the country.”\n\nNelson concluded, “People across the political spectrum can and should disagree on issues, even of the most profound importance. But for our democracy to endure another 250 years and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts.”\n\nReportedly, Fox News has a pending defamation lawsuit filed by another voting machine company named Smartmatic.

                    "snippet": "Fox and Dominion Voting Systems reached a settlement Tuesday in the voting machine company’s defamation lawsuit, averting a trial in a case that exposed how the top-rated network chased viewers by promoting lies about the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAn attorney for Dominion said the settlement was for $787.5 million.\n\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” said Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson in a news conference outside the courthouse after the announcement.\n\nDominion had asked for $1.6 billion in arguing that Fox had damaged its reputation by helping peddle phony conspiracy theories about its equipment switching votes from former President Donald Trump to Democrat Joe Biden. Fox said the amount greatly overstated the value of the Colorado-based company.\n\nThe resolution announced in Delaware Superior Court follows a recent summary judgment ruling by Judge Eric Davis in which he allowed the case to go to trial while emphasizing it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations about Dominion aired on Fox by Trump allies were true.\n\nIn a statement issued shortly after the announcement, Fox News said the network acknowledged “the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.” It did not respond to an inquiry asking for elaboration.\n\nInquiries to Dominion and Fox Corp. were not immediately returned.\n\nRecords released as part of the lawsuit showed how Fox hosts and executives did not believe the claims by Trump’s allies but aired them anyway, in part to win back viewers who were fleeing the network after it correctly called hotly contested Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden on election night.\n\nThe settlement, if formally accepted by the judge, will end a case that has proven a major embarrassment for Fox News. If the case had gone to trial, it also would have presented one of the sternest tests to a libel standard that has protected media organizations for more than half a century.\n\nSeveral First Amendment experts had said Dominion’s case was among the strongest they had ever seen. Still, there was real doubt about whether Dominion would be able to prove to a jury that people in a decision-making capacity at Fox could be held responsible for the network’s airing of the falsehoods.\n\nDominion accused Fox of defaming it by repeatedly airing, in the weeks after the 2020 presidential election, false allegations by Trump allies that its machines and the software they used had flipped votes to Biden — even as many at the network doubted the claims and disparaged those who were making them.\n\nThe company sued both Fox News and its parent, Fox Corp., and said its business had been significantly damaged.\n\nDuring a deposition, Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who founded the network, testified that he believed the 2020 election was fair and had not been stolen from Trump.\n\n“Fox knew the truth,” Dominion argued in court papers. “It knew the allegations against Dominion were ‘outlandish’ and ‘crazy’ and ‘ludicrous’ and ‘nuts.’ Yet it used the power and influence of its platform to promote that false story.”\n\nIn his March 31 summary judgment ruling, Davis pointedly called out the news organization for airing falsehoods while noting how the bogus election claims persist, 2 1/2 years after Trump lost his bid for reelection.\n\n“The statements at issue were dramatically different than the truth,” Davis said in that ruling. “In fact, although it cannot be attributed directly to Fox’s statements, it is noteworthy that some Americans still believe the election was rigged.”\n\nIn its defense, Fox said it was obligated to report on the most newsworthy of stories — a president claiming that he had been cheated out of reelection.\n\n“We never reported those to be true,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said. “All we ever did was provide viewers the true fact that these were allegations that were being made.”\n\nFox said Dominion had argued that the network was obligated to suppress the allegations or denounce them as false.\n\n“Freedom of speech and of the press would be illusory if the prevailing side in a public controversy could sue the press for giving a forum to the losing side,” Fox said in court papers.\n\nIn a 1964 case involving The New York Times, the U.S. Supreme Court limited the ability of public figures to sue for defamation. The court ruled that plaintiffs needed to prove that news outlets published or aired false material with “actual malice” — knowing such material was false or acting with a “reckless disregard” for whether or not it was true.\n\nThat has provided news organizations with stout protection against libel judgments. Yet the nearly six-decade legal standard has come under attack by some conservatives in recent years, including Trump and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who have argued for making it easier to win a libel case.\n\nTwo Republican-nominated Supreme Court justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have publicly expressed interest in revisiting the protection.\n\nDominion’s lawyers argued that Fox made a deliberate decision to repeatedly air the false claims to appeal to viewers. They allowed guests to falsely claim that the company had rigged the election, flipped large numbers of votes to Biden through a secret algorithm, was owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chavez, the late president, and bribed government officials.\n\n“What they did to get viewers back was start this new narrative that the election had been stolen and that Dominion was the thief,” Dominion lawyer Rodney Smolla said during a March hearing.\n\nA mountain of evidence — released in the form of deposition transcripts, internal memos and emails from the time — was damaging to Fox even if some of it was only tangentially related to the libel argument.\n\nDominion has pointed to text and email messages in which Fox insiders discounted and sometimes overtly mocked the vote manipulation claims. One Fox Corp. vice president called them “MIND BLOWINGLY NUTS.”\n\nMuch of the material showed a network effectively terrified of its audience after its election night declaration that Biden had won Arizona. The race call infuriated Trump and many viewers who supported him.\n\nOne of Fox’s top news anchors, Bret Baier, noted the audience’s anger and suggested rescinding the call, even awarding the state to Trump.\n\n“We don’t want to antagonize Trump further,” Murdoch said in a Nov. 16 memo.\n\nBiden narrowly won Arizona, but two executives responsible for the accurate election night call lost their jobs because of it two months later. In an internal memo, Murdoch talked in mid-November about firing them.\n\nFox executives and anchors discussed how not to alienate the audience, many of whom believed Trump’s claims of fraud despite no evidence to back them up. Fox’s Tucker Carlson suggested a news reporter be fired for tweeting a fact check debunking the fraud claims.\n\nSome of the exhibits were simply embarrassing, such as scornful behind-the-scenes opinions about Trump, whose supporters form the core of the network’s viewers. Text exchanges revealed as part of the lawsuit show Carlson declaring, “I hate him passionately,” and saying that “we are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.”\n\n___",

                    "snippet": "The Fox News defamation case was not, in fact, as entertaining as Succession. On the first day of trial, Fox settled with Dominion Voting Systems, heading off a process that could have aired embarrassing revelations about the news giant. Dominion says the settlement included a $787 million payout — apparently enough to compensate it for months of false claims about the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAs The New York Times reports, a Delaware judge announced the settlement after a morning of jury selection and just before attorneys’ opening statements. The dismissal means Fox Corporation won’t have to put some of its biggest names on the stand, including chairman Rupert Murdoch and Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Dominion revealed the payment in a press conference. “Money is accountability and we got that today from Fox,” said Dominion attorney Stephen Shackleford, according to CNN reporter Oliver Darcy. Dominion had originally sought $1.6 billion.\n\nIn a statement, Fox News Media conceded parts of Dominion’s allegations in vague terms. “We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems,” it said. “We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nAs alluded to by Fox, a judge had already ruled that Fox aired false claims about Dominion’s role in the election, including that the company had attempted to covertly engineer the defeat of former President Donald Trump. Dominion still had to establish that the statements were made with “actual malice,” a high bar that would require demonstrating Fox knew the statements were false or seriously doubted them. While it’s difficult to meet the actual malice standard, Fox was widely understood to be in a weak position. The case surfaced text messages revealing that Fox News stars like Carlson were ambivalent about promoting Trump’s election lies, and just before the trial, it was sanctioned for withholding evidence.",

There is no requirement for an on-air apology as part of the settlement, a Dominion representative and second source close to the company told CBS News.\n\nA spokesperson for the voting technology company said in a statement that, \"An apology is about accountability, and today Dominion held Fox accountable. Fox paid a historic settlement and issued a statement acknowledging that the statements about Dominion were false.\"\n\nNelson told reporters the outcome represents \"accountability.\"\n\n\"Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy,\" he said.\n\nAny additional details of the settlement are unclear, and the case's resolution came on the first day of the trial in Delaware Superior Court. A 12-member jury and the alternates were seated in the morning and sworn in, after which lawyers for the two sides were set to deliver opening statements Tuesday afternoon. The settlement brings an end to what was expected to be a six-week trial.\n\nThe start of the trial had already been delayed by one day, from Monday to Tuesday.\n\nThe agreement marks the culmination of Dominion's two-year lawsuit against Fox News and its parent company Fox Corporation over false claims about the integrity of the 2020 election and spares the network's top stars and Murdoch from having to take the stand.\n\nThe electronic voting company alleged Fox defamed it by broadcasting unfounded allegations that Dominion had rigged the election against Trump and its software manipulated vote counts. The electronic voting company sought $1.6 billion in damages.\n\nEvidence was expected to be voluminous at the trial, after filings from Dominion's and Fox's legal teams indicated there would be over 7,000 and more than 5,000 exhibits, respectively. Before the trial, reams of text messages and internal emails from Fox's hosts, producers and executives were made public as part of the lawsuit, and many showed the network's best-known stars didn't believe the claims that were being pushed by the former president and his allies.\n\nThe communications also provided a behind-the-scenes look at the atmosphere inside Fox after the network was the first to call Arizona for Joe Biden on election night. The move led viewers to change the channel from Fox to rival networks amid pushback from Trump and his campaign, setting off alarm bells within the cable giant.\n\nDominion pointed to 20 statements — many made by conservative lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani — aired on shows hosted by Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs, Jeanine Pirro, Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity or on Twitter that the voting equipment and software company argues were defamatory.\n\nThe trial was expected to be a high-stakes test of the boundaries of the First Amendment, as Fox's lawyers argued the claims it aired about Dominion were newsworthy, because Trump's top allies and lawyers had made the statements, and also because of when the statements were made and what they concerned. Fox also claimed that the broadcasts are constitutionally protected.\n\nBut in an opinion published in late March, Davis pushed back against several of Fox's defenses, calling it \"oxymoronic\" to call the challenged 20 statements opinions while also asserting they were newsworthy allegations. Davis, who reviewed all 20 broadcasts where the falsehoods about Dominion were made, said in his opinion that it's \"crystal clear\" that none of the statements relating to the electronic voting company are true.\n\nHe also rebuked Fox's attorneys during a pre-trial conference last week after Dominion alleged the cable news giant had withheld evidence and information. A lawyer for Fox apologized to Davis in a letter Friday, writing the network's legal team is \"committed to clear and full communication with the Court moving forward.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether Fox and Dominion had discussed a potential settlement earlier in the case, but the two sides previously met late last year for court-ordered mediation and did not immediately reach an agreement.\n\nWhile the settlement resolves the dispute between Fox and Dominion, the network is facing another defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, a voting machine company, over unfounded claims that it was part of a campaign to rig the election in favor of Mr. Biden.\n\nSmartmatic filed its lawsuit in New York state court in February 2021 and is seeking $2.7 billion.\n\n\"Dominion's litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox's disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest,\" J. Erik Connolly, the company's lawyer said, in a statement. \"Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company in more than 50 countries, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy.\"",

                    "snippet": "Fox and the voting equipment company Dominion reached a US$787.5m settlement in a closely watched defamation lawsuit, ending a dispute over whether the network and its parent company knowingly broadcast false and outlandish allegations that Dominion was involved in a plot to steal the 2020 election.\n\nThe settlement came before scheduled opening statements and after an unexpected lengthy delay Tuesday afternoon just after the jury was sworn in. Neither party immediately disclosed the terms of the settlement other than the dollar amount, and attorneys for Dominion declined to answer questions about whether it requires Fox to issue a retraction or a formal apology.\n\n“The parties have resolved their case,” judge Eric Davis told jurors on Tuesday afternoon before excusing them from the courtroom.\n\nIn a press conference outside the courthouse, Dominion attorney Justin Nelson said the more than $787m represented “vindication and accountability”. The settlement amount is less than half of the $1.6bn Dominion demanded in its lawsuit.\n\n“Truth matters,” he said. “Lies have consequences. The truth does not know red or blue,” he continued. “People across the political spectrum can and should disagree on issues, even of the most profound importance. But for our democracy to endure another 250 years and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts.”\n\nIn a statement, Fox said the settlement reflects its “continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards”.\n\n“We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” the statement said.\n\nMembers of the Fox legal team walk back to their offices on Tuesday after a settlement with Dominion Voting Systems.

During the more than two-hour delay, attorneys huddled and left the courtroom to convene in adjacent meeting rooms.\n\nAfter returning to the courtroom, Davis thanked the jurors for their service, and called the efforts by the lawyers on both sides “the best lawyering I’ve had, ever” in his career on the bench since 2010.\n\nThe anticipated six-week jury trial was originally set to begin on Monday, but Davis, the judge overseeing the case, postponed the start of trial by a day as the sides worked to reach a settlement agreement.\n\nThe trial in Wilmington, Delaware, was set to be a blockbuster media trial. Rupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old chief executive of Fox, was called to testify in the case, along with top Fox talent including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro and Maria Bartiromo.\n\nThe lawsuit was seen as one of the most aggressive efforts to hold Fox, or any actor, accountable for spreading the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. It was a lie that led to threats against election officials across the country, and ultimately helped fuel the violent attack on the US Capitol on 6 January. Nine deaths have been linked to the event.\n\nThough the case was settled, Dominion had unearthed a stunning trove of internal communications from Fox laying bare how top talent and hosts knew the outlandish claims about Dominion and a stolen election were false. The extensive messages offered a remarkable insight into how some of the most powerful hosts in America did not buy the allegations they were broadcasting to their audience each night.\n\nDominion, a relatively obscure company until the 2020 election, sought $1.6bn in damages in the case. It challenged repeated claims made on Fox’s air after the general election that Dominion switched votes, paid government kickbacks, and was founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chávez.\n\nIn the press conference Tuesday, Dominion CEO John Poulos called the settlement historic because of Fox’s admission that it was telling lies.\n\n“Throughout this process, we have sought accountability,” he said. “We believe the evidence brought to light through this case underscores the consequences of spreading lies. Truthful reporting in the media is essential to our democracy.”\n\nJustin Nelson, a lawyer for Dominion, called the settlement a ‘vindication’. Photograph: Saquan Stimpson/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock\n\nEven before trial, Davis had already concluded that Fox’s claims about Dominion were false. “The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,” he wrote in a ruling earlier this month.\n\nThe question that would have been before the jury was whether Fox committed “actual malice” in airing the claims. That required Dominion to show whether key decision makers were aware the claims were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nFox still faces several legal battles related to its decision to broadcast false claims. Smartmatic, another voting equipment company, is suing the company for $2.7bn. Abby Grossberg, a former Fox employee who worked for Bartiromo and Carlson, is also suing the company, alleging she was coerced into giving misleading testimony.\n\nThe network also faces a separate lawsuit from a shareholder who is seeking damages and argues that executives breached their fiduciary duty to the company by causing false claims about the election to be broadcast.\n\nDuring the press conference, Stephen Shackelford, an attorney who was set to give opening arguments for Dominion on Tuesday, said that the company will continue seeking accountability.\n\n“Money is accountability,” he said. “We got that today from Fox. But we’re not done yet. We’ve got some other people who have some accountability coming for them.”",

                    "snippet": "Fox and Dominion Voting Systems reached an 11th-hour, $787.5 million settlement Tuesday in the voting machine company’s defamation lawsuit against the conservative broadcast network for airing lies about its voting systems and the 2020 election that were championed by former President Donald Trump and his allies.\n\nThe settlement, reached just moments before opening arguments were set to begin, ends an embarrassing multi-year ordeal for Fox, and means that the company will avoid the specter of potentially blockbuster testimony from some of its network stars, including Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, as well as Fox News Corp executive chairman Rupert Murdoch.\n\nDominion was suing Fox for $1.6 billion in damages. It’s unclear if the settlement, which is about half of the initial figure, will also include any sort of public statement or apology from Fox. The judge in the case announced that it had been resolved on Tuesday afternoon, after a day-and-a-half delay of the start of the trial.\n\nDominion attorney Justin Nelson described the settlement Tuesday as a “ringing endorsement for truth and democracy.”\n\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” Nelson said. “Over two years ago, a torrent of lies swept Dominion and election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories, causing grievous harm to Dominion and the country.”\n\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis had ruled that it was “CRYSTAL clear” that Fox aired untrue statements about Dominion voting machines and the 2020 election and had allowed the case to go to trial. But the trial was set to center not on if the statements were lies, but on if Dominion could prove that Fox acted with “actual malice” – the standard that protects news organizations from defamation and libel lawsuits, and is typically a very high bar for plaintiffs to clear.\n\nFirst Amendment experts have said that Dominion’s case was one of the strongest in recent memory. The trial was set to be one of the most consequential tests of media and First Amendment law in decades.\n\n\n\nPolitical Cartoons View All 949 Images\n\nInformation unearthed as part of the lawsuit proved extremely damaging for Fox. Texts, emails and other information uncovered showed that Fox hosts, executives and other staff members did not believe lies peddled by Trump and his allies about fraud and voting machine issues in the 2020 election, but chose to air them anyway in a bid to keep conservative viewers and help the company’s bottom line.\n\nThe materials uncovered during the discovery process also included unflattering messages from Fox hosts about the politicians they promoted on their shows, including Trump.\n\nDominion alleged that by inviting guests on Fox shows that peddled the voter fraud allegation, and by not pushing back on those allegations and, in some cases, directly promoting them, Fox knowingly pushed lies and damaged the company.\n\nFox had argued that the lies – including the allegations by Trump himself – were by definition newsworthy, and that it was engaging in news reporting activity protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday after the settlement, Fox said it acknowledged “the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.”\n\n“This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” the statement said.\n\nFox is also facing a lawsuit from another voting systems company, Smartmatic.",

                    "snippet": "WILMINGTON, Del. — Fox and Dominion Voting Systems reached a $787 million settlement Tuesday in the voting machine company’s defamation lawsuit, averting a trial in a case that exposed how the top-rated network chased viewers by promoting lies about the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said in a news conference outside the courthouse after a judge announced the deal.\n\nDominion had asked for $1.6 billion, arguing that Fox had damaged its reputation by helping peddle phony conspiracy theories about its equipment switching votes from former President Donald Trump to Democrat Joe Biden. Fox said the amount greatly overstated the value of the Colorado-based company.\n\nThe resolution in Delaware Superior Court follows a recent ruling by Judge Eric Davis in which he allowed the case to go to trial while emphasizing it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations about Dominion aired on Fox by Trump allies was true.\n\nIn a statement issued shortly after the announcement, Fox News said the network acknowledged “the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.” It did not respond to an inquiry asking for elaboration.\n\nInquiries to Dominion and Fox Corp. were not immediately returned.\n\nRecords released as part of the lawsuit showed how Fox hosts and executives did not believe the claims by Trump’s allies but aired them anyway, in part to win back viewers who were fleeing the network after it correctly called hotly contested Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden on election night.\n\nThe settlement, which does not need the judge’s approval, will end a case that has proven a major embarrassment for Fox News. If the case had gone to trial, it also would have presented one of the sternest tests to a libel standard that has protected media organizations for more than half a century.\n\nSeveral First Amendment experts had said Dominion’s case was among the strongest they had ever seen. Still, there was real doubt about whether Dominion would be able to prove to a jury that people in a decision-making capacity at Fox could be held responsible for the network’s airing of the falsehoods.\n\nDominion accused Fox of defaming it by repeatedly airing, in the weeks after the election, false allegations by Trump allies that the company’s machines had flipped votes to Biden — even as many at the network doubted the claims and disparaged those who were making them.\n\nThe company sued both Fox News and its parent, Fox Corp., and said its business had been significantly damaged.\n\nDuring a deposition, Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who founded the network, testified that he believed the 2020 election was fair and had not been stolen from Trump.\n\n“Fox knew the truth,” Dominion argued in court papers. “It knew the allegations against Dominion were ‘outlandish’ and ‘crazy’ and ‘ludicrous’ and ‘nuts.’ Yet it used the power and influence of its platform to promote that false story.”\n\nIn a March 31 ruling, Davis pointedly called out the news organization for airing falsehoods while noting how the bogus election claims still persist, 2 1/2 years after Trump lost his bid for reelection.\n\n“The statements at issue were dramatically different than the truth,” Davis said in that ruling. “In fact, although it cannot be attributed directly to Fox’s statements, it is noteworthy that some Americans still believe the election was rigged.”\n\nIn its defense, Fox said it was obligated to report on the most newsworthy of stories — a president claiming that he had been cheated out of reelection.\n\n“We never reported those to be true,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said. “All we ever did was provide viewers the true fact that these were allegations that were being made.”\n\nFox said Dominion had argued that the network was obligated to suppress the allegations or denounce them as false.\n\n“Freedom of speech and of the press would be illusory if the prevailing side in a public controversy could sue the press for giving a forum to the losing side,” Fox said in court papers.\n\nIn a 1964 case involving The New York Times, the U.S. Supreme Court limited the ability of public figures to sue for defamation. The court ruled that plaintiffs needed to prove that news outlets published or aired false material with “actual malice” — knowing such material was false or acting with a “reckless disregard” for whether or not it was true.\n\nThat has provided news organizations with stout protection against libel judgments. Yet the nearly six-decade legal standard has come under attack by some conservatives in recent years, including Trump and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who have argued for making it easier to win a libel case.\n\nTwo Republican-nominated Supreme Court justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have publicly expressed interest in revisiting the protection.\n\nDominion’s lawyers argued that Fox made a deliberate decision to repeatedly air the false claims to appeal to viewers. They allowed guests to falsely claim that the company had rigged the election, flipped large numbers of votes to Biden through a secret algorithm, was owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chavez, and bribed government officials.\n\n“What they did to get viewers back was start this new narrative that the election had been stolen and that Dominion was the thief,” Dominion lawyer Rodney Smolla said during a March hearing.\n\nA mountain of evidence — released in the form of deposition transcripts, internal memos and emails from the time — was damaging to Fox even if some of it was only tangentially related to the libel argument.\n\nDominion has pointed to text and email messages in which Fox insiders discounted and sometimes overtly mocked the vote manipulation claims. One Fox Corp. vice president called them “MIND BLOWINGLY NUTS.”\n\nMuch of the material showed a network effectively terrified of its audience after its election night declaration that Biden had won Arizona. The race call infuriated Trump and many viewers who supported him.\n\nOne of Fox’s top news anchors, Bret Baier, noted the audience’s anger and suggested rescinding the call, even awarding the state to Trump.\n\n“We don’t want to antagonize Trump further,” Murdoch said in a Nov. 16 memo.\n\nBiden narrowly won Arizona, but two executives responsible for the accurate election night call lost their jobs because of it two months later. In an internal memo, Murdoch talked in mid-November about firing them.\n\nFox executives and anchors discussed how not to alienate the audience, many of whom believed Trump’s claims of fraud despite no evidence to back them up. Fox’s Tucker Carlson suggested a news reporter be fired for tweeting a fact check debunking the fraud claims.\n\nSome of the exhibits were simply embarrassing, such as scornful behind-the-scenes opinions about Trump, whose supporters form the core of the network’s viewers. Text exchanges revealed as part of the lawsuit show Carlson declaring, “I hate him passionately,” and saying that “we are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.”\n\n",

                    "snippet": "Pinned\n\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” a lawyer for Dominion Voting Systems, Justin Nelson, in a red tie, said on Tuesday in Wilmington, Del.\n\nFox News abruptly agreed on Tuesday to pay $787.5 million to resolve a defamation suit filed by Dominion Voting Systems over the network’s promotion of misinformation about the 2020 election, averting a lengthy and embarrassing trial just as a packed courtroom was seated in anticipation of hearing opening statements.\n\nThe settlement, one of the largest ever in a defamation case, was the latest extraordinary twist in a case that has been full of remarkable disclosures that exposed the inner workings of the most powerful voice in conservative news.\n\nIn addition to the huge financial price, Dominion exacted a difficult admission from Fox News, which acknowledged in a statement that “certain claims” it made about Dominion were false.\n\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” Justin Nelson, a lawyer for Dominion, said outside Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday.\n\nVideo “Lies have consequences,” a lawyer for Dominion Voting Systems said during a news conference. Credit Credit... Pete Marovich for The New York Times\n\nNews of the 11th-hour agreement stunned the full courtroom in Wilmington, where the case was being heard. Gasps filled the air when Judge Eric M. Davis told the jury shortly before 4 p.m. that the two parties had resolved the matter. Lawyers for both sides had been preparing to speak to the jury for the first time, microphones clipped to their jacket lapels.\n\nThe settlement spares Fox a trial that would have gone on for weeks and put many of the company’s most prominent figures — from the media mogul Rupert Murdoch to hosts like Tucker Carlson and Maria Bartiromo — on the stand.\n\nThe case held the potential to make public a stream of damaging information about how the network told its audience a story of fraud and interference in the 2020 presidential election that many of its own executives and on-screen personalities did not believe. And the network was not forced to apologize — a concession that Dominion lawyers had sought, lawyers involved in the case said.\n\nDominion sued two years ago, after Fox aired false stories claiming that Dominion’s voting machines were susceptible to hacking and had flipped votes from President Donald J. Trump to Joseph R. Biden Jr. On Tuesday, the company expressed a sense of exoneration about the large financial cost that Fox will have to pay. While Dominion’s suit asked for damages of $1.6 billion, almost double the settlement figure, the company will avoid many years of appeals that could have trimmed or eliminated any payout from a trial.\n\n“Over two years ago, a torrent of lies swept Dominion and election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories causing grievous harm to Dominion and the country,” Mr. Nelson said. “Today’s settlement of $787.5 million represents vindication and accountability.”\n\nThe case and the expected trial were significant because they raised the prospect for an elusive judgment in the post-Trump era: Very few allies of the former president’s have been held legally accountable for their roles in spreading the falsehoods that undermined confidence in the country’s democratic process and cast Mr. Biden’s victory as illegitimate. Polls show that large numbers of Republicans still believe the 2020 election was tainted.\n\nThe size of the settlement, experts said, seems to have little precedent. RonNell Andersen Jones, a professor of law at the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah, said she believed it was one of the largest settlements in a defamation case ever.\n\n“This was unquestionably the strongest defamation case we’ve ever seen against a major media company,” Ms. Andersen Jones said. The case was even more unusual, she added, because media companies typically seek to settle well before so much damaging information about their internal workings is released.\n\nA deal came together at the last possible minute, after months of almost no serious discussion between the two sides. As the case proceeded, Dominion divulged extraordinary details about the doubts that Fox employees expressed privately about voter fraud claims, even as they struck a different tone on the air.\n\n“Settlement before this trove of evidence became public would of course have been in Fox’s best interest,” Ms. Andersen Jones said. “Waiting until the eve of trial, when the whole nation had a chance to focus on what Fox said internally about Trump, its sources and its own viewers, gave Dominion the extra layer of accountability it was seeking.”\n\nIt is uncommon for defamation suits to get to trial, in part because the bar for proving “actual malice” — the legal standard that requires plaintiffs to show that defendants knew what they were saying was a lie, or had a reckless disregard for the truth — is so high. It is rarer yet for one to feature the volume of evidence that Dominion had amassed against Fox.\n\nIn the run-up to trial, Dominion publicly released reams of internal communications among Fox executives, hosts and producers that revealed how the country’s most-watched cable news network set in motion a strategy to win back viewers who had tuned out after Mr. Trump’s loss. The messages tell the story of a frantic scramble inside Fox as it started losing audience share to competitors, like Newsmax, that were more willing to report on and endorse false claims about a plot involving Dominion machines to steal the election from Mr. Trump.\n\nProducers referred to pro-Trump guests like Sidney Powell and Rudolph W. Giuliani as “gold” for ratings and acknowledged that the audience didn’t want to hear about subjects like the possibility of a peaceful transition from a Trump administration to a Biden administration.\n\nThose communications have shown how employees at Fox expressed serious doubts about and, at times, were scornful of Mr. Trump and his allies as they spread lies about voter fraud, questioning the legitimacy of Mr. Biden’s election. Some at Fox mocked Mr. Trump and his lawyers as “crazy” and under the influence of drugs like L.S.D. and magic mushrooms.\n\nSome Fox hosts privately described their colleagues as “reckless” for endorsing Mr. Trump’s false claims, acknowledging that there was “no evidence” to back them up. Yet for weeks, Fox continued to give a platform to election deniers, despite doubts about their credibility. Dominion challenged statements made on multiple programs on multiple nights. Typically, defamation cases involve only a single disputed statement.\n\nThe trial would have been a spectacle. Mr. Murdoch, whose family controls the Fox media empire, was slated to be one of Dominion’s first witnesses this week. Star anchors including Sean Hannity, Mr. Carlson and Ms. Bartiromo were likely to be called at other points.\n\nEven the most blockbuster media trials of the last generation — Ariel Sharon’s suit against Time and Gen. William C. Westmoreland’s against CBS, both in the 1980s — lacked the most explosive elements of this case, which raised weighty questions about the protections the First Amendment affords the media and whether one of the most influential forces in conservative politics would have to pay a price for amplifying misinformation.\n\nBoth of those cases were settled out of court, too.\n\nIn recent days, Fox raised questions about Dominion’s claims of damages. On Monday, it disputed Dominion’s worth, pointing to a recent legal filing in which the company lowered part of its request for compensation. Fox lawyers also raised doubts about the harm that Dominion had suffered, saying the company acknowledged that it had turned a profit in recent years.\n\nBut the potential pitfalls for proceeding with a trial were real for Fox. Some of the revelations from the depositions that Dominion had conducted offered a preview of how damaging a trial could be. Mr. Murdoch acknowledged during his deposition that some Fox hosts had “endorsed” Mr. Trump’s lies, an admission that undercut Fox’s defense that it was merely reporting on — not amplifying — the former president’s claims.\n\nAfter the deposition concluded, the general counsel of Fox Corporation, Viet Dinh, tried to reassure Mr. Murdoch that he had done well.\n\n“I’m just going to say it. They didn’t lay a finger on you,” Mr. Dinh said.\n\nMr. Murdoch disagreed, according to a person who witnessed the exchange. He pointed a finger at the lawyer who had questioned him for Dominion, Mr. Nelson, and said, “I think he would strongly disagree with that.”\n\nTo which Mr. Nelson replied, “Indeed, I do.”",

                    "snippet": "UPDATED with Fox News statement, settlement sums & Dominion CEO remarks: Fox News has settled Dominion Voting Systems’ $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the Rupert Murdoch-owned organization, averting a lengthy, expensive and certain to be embarrassing trial.\n\n“The parties have resolved their case,” Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis just told the court Tuesday afternoon, offering no details. News of the settlement was strategically made public right before Wall Street ceased trading for the day.\n\nFox paid Dominion $787.5 million under the deal, lawyers for the company said afterwards outside the courtroom. “Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees and the customers we serve,” said Dominion CEO John Poulos. “Nothing can make up for that.”\n\nFox News is not required to air an apology or retraction, sources said. However, Fox was quick to address the settlement in crafted language that appears to softly walk back claims amplified by hosts and guests that the 2020 election was stolen from incumbent Donald Trump.\n\n“We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems,” a Fox spokesperson said after the agreement was announced. “We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nFollowing a flurry of post-lunch break activity today in and out of Judge Davis’ chambers, the agreement comes soon after the 12-person jury was seated and a special master had been appointed to probe Fox compliance. Opening statements were set to begin later in the day, but that plan went awry as spectators sat in the courtroom for nearly two hours with no idea about what was going on.\n\nAlthough a settlement is nothing new to Fox and Murdoch-owned entities, things had seemed until well into this morning to be going full steam into a six-week trial. With the flood of scathing and hypocritical internal correspondence emerging over recent weeks between execs and Fox hosts like Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham over Trump and his false claims of the 2020 election being stolen, it looked like the company was eager to make a deal with the private equity-backed Dominion and spare the 92-year-old Murdoch having to testify.\n\nA hint of that seemed to be on the horizon in the past 48 hours.\n\nOn Sunday night, just more than 12 hours before jurors were to be picked and seated, Judge Davis suddenly delayed the start of the trial Tuesday. The move triggered immediate speculation that both sides were engaged in some kind of huddle to reach a resolution. talks were said to be underway this weekend, but the situation remained “fluid,” according to a well-positioned legal source.\n\nOn Monday morning, the judge publicly reiterated his statement of the evening before, saying “I have made the decision to delay the start of the trial until tomorrow. With only one attorney from each side present, the judge offered an otherwise packed Wilmington courtroom and media overflow room no reason for the delay, but said that such occurrences are not “unusual” in such proceedings.\n\nThe high-profile trial would likely have meant an array of Fox executives, including the elder Murdoch and board member and ex-House Speaker Paul Ryan, would take the stand for live testimony. Additionally, some of the network’s best known and most controversial hosts including Carlson, Hannity and Maria Bartiromo were on Dominion’s witness list as was Fox boss Lachlan Murdoch.\n\nIn what looked to be another damning portrait of the Murdoch-own conservative outlet, Dominion’s attorneys planned to offer up emails and text messages showing that the Murdochs, other top Fox brass and news personalities personally doubted and derided Trump’s claims that the 2020 election was rigged, yet still let the allegations be amplified on-air by hosts and guests. Many of those correspondences have already come out in pre-trial filings and hearings; they were ignored by Fox on-air and left a distinct stink in the court of public opinion.\n\nDavis ruled in late March that the case could move forward to trial, rejecting one of Fox’s claims that the network was merely covering a president’s newsworthy allegations of election fraud. He determined that the claims made on air about Dominion were false, leaving it to the jury to decide whether the network was liable for actual malice. He also left it to the jury to determine whether Fox Corp., not just Fox News, was liable.\n\nThe Delaware judge also said he planned to appoint a special master to investigate claims that Fox had withheld evidence in the case. That could have led to sanctions against the Fox legal team, though one of its attorneys wrote a letter and apologized to the judge, characterizing it as a misunderstanding.\n\nA trial would have been one of the most closely watched defamation trials in recent memory, with a potential impact on judicial interpretation of the law if the jury’s verdict was appealed to higher courts.\n\nHaving settled this matter and a related defamation suit brought by Venezuelan businessman Majed Khalil on April 9, Fox still faces a massive lawsuit from another election systems company, Smartmatic, which filed a $2.7 billion lawsuit. Dominion and Smartmatic also have claims against two other conservative news outlets, Newsmax and One America News.\n\nA Newsmax spokesperson said that they believe “the facts at issue in Dominion’s case against it are materially different from those that may have driven Fox to settle, and no conclusion about Newsmax should be drawn from that settlement. Newsmax stands by its coverage and analysis of the 2020 election and will continue to vigorously defend against the claim.”",

                    "snippet": "WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Fox News agreed Tuesday to pay Dominion Voting Systems nearly $800 million to avert a trial in the voting machine company’s lawsuit that would have exposed how the network promoted lies about the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe stunning settlement emerged just as opening statements were supposed to begin, abruptly ending a case that had embarrassed Fox News over several months and raised the possibility that network founder Rupert Murdoch and stars such as Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity would have to testify publicly.\n\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson told reporters outside a Delaware courthouse after Superior Court Judge Eric Davis announced the deal.\n\nJustin Nelson, an attorney for Dominion Voting Systems, speaks about the settlement reached with Fox News. (CNN)\n\nOutside of the $787.5 million promised to Colorado-based Dominion, it was unclear what other consequences Fox would face. Fox acknowledged in a statement “the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” but no apology was offered.\n\n“We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” Fox said. Its lawyers and representatives offered no other comment or details about the settlement.\n\nAsked by a reporter whether there was “anything to this other than money,” Dominion CEO John Poulos did not answer.\n\nThe deal is a significant amount of money even for a company the size of Fox. It represents about one-quarter of the $2.96 billion the company reported earning last year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — a figure often used to approximate a company’s cash flow.\n\nThe settlement also follows a $965 million judgment issued against Alex Jones by a Connecticut jury in 2022 for spreading false conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook school massacre.\n\nCoupled with other lawsuits in the pipeline, the agreement shows there is a real financial risk for conservative media that traffic in conspiracy theories. What remains unknown is how much of a deterrent this will be. Even as the Dominion case loomed this spring, Fox’s Tucker Carlson aired his alternate theories about what happened at the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nDominion had sued Fox for $1.6 billion, arguing that the top-rated news outlet had damaged the company’s reputation by peddling phony conspiracy theories that claimed its equipment switched votes from former President Donald Trump to Democrat Joe Biden. Davis, in an earlier ruling, said it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations about Dominion aired on Fox by Trump allies were true.\n\nDominion set out to prove in the lawsuit that Fox acted with malice in airing allegations that it knew to be false, or with “reckless disregard” for the truth. It presented volumes of internal emails and text messages that showed Fox executives and personalities saying they knew the accusations were untrue, even as the falsehoods were aired on programs hosted by Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs and Jeannine Pirro.\n\nRecords released as part of the lawsuit showed that Fox aired the claims in part to win back viewers who were fleeing the network after it correctly called hotly contested Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden on election night. One Fox Corp. vice president called them “MIND BLOWINGLY NUTS.”\n\nDuring a deposition, Murdoch testified that he believed the 2020 election was fair and had not been stolen from Trump.\n\n“Fox knew the truth,” Dominion argued in court papers. “It knew the allegations against Dominion were ‘outlandish’ and ‘crazy’ and ‘ludicrous’ and ‘nuts.’ Yet it used the power and influence of its platform to promote that false story.”\n\nSeveral First Amendment experts said Dominion’s case was among the strongest they had ever seen. But there was real doubt about whether Dominion would be able to prove to a jury that people in a decision-making capacity at Fox could be held responsible for the network’s actions.\n\nDominion’s Nelson called the settlement “a tremendous victory” and noted that there are six more lawsuits pending regarding election claims.\n\n“We settled because it was about accountability,” Nelson said in an interview. “Our goals were to make sure that there was accountability for the lies, and to try to make our client right. And we accomplished both goals.”\n\nIt’s hard to tell what the deal will mean financially for Dominion. The company would not provide its most recent earnings, saying the figures were not public.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the trial, Davis significantly narrowed Fox’s potential line of defense, including nixing the network’s argument that it was merely airing newsworthy allegations. Newsworthiness is not a defense against defamation, he said.\n\nIn a March 31 ruling, he pointedly called out the network for airing falsehoods while noting that bogus election claims still persist more than two years after Trump lost his bid for reelection.\n\n“The statements at issue were dramatically different than the truth,” Davis said in that ruling. “In fact, although it cannot be attributed directly to Fox’s statements, it is noteworthy that some Americans still believe the election was rigged.”\n\nIn its defense, Fox said it was obligated to report on a president who claimed that he had been cheated out of reelection.\n\n“We never reported those to be true,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said. “All we ever did was provide viewers the true fact that these were allegations that were being made.”\n\nDominion had sued both Fox News and its parent, Fox Corp, and said its business had been significantly damaged. Fox said the company grossly overestimated its losses, before agreeing to pay about half of what Dominion had asked for.\n\nIn a 1964 case involving The New York Times, the U.S. Supreme Court limited the ability of public figures to sue for defamation. The court ruled that plaintiffs needed to prove that news outlets published or aired false material with “actual malice” — knowing such material was false or acting with a “reckless disregard” for whether or not it was true.\n\nThat has provided news organizations with stout protection against libel judgments. Yet the nearly six-decade legal standard has come under attack by some conservatives in recent years, including Trump and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who have argued for making it easier to win a libel case.\n\n“The larger importance of the settlement ... is that the high level of protection for news media in a defamation case remains intact from now,” said Doreen Weisenhaus, an instructor of media law at Northwestern University.\n\nIn documents released in recent months, Fox executives and anchors discussed how not to alienate the audience, many of whom believed Trump’s claims of fraud despite no evidence to back them up. Fox’s Tucker Carlson suggested a news reporter be fired for tweeting a fact check debunking the fraud claims.\n\nSome of the exhibits were simply embarrassing, such as scornful behind-the-scenes opinions about Trump, whose supporters form the core of the network’s viewers.

                    "snippet": "Wilmington, Delaware CNN —\n\nFox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end a colossal two-year legal battle that publicly shredded the right-wing network’s credibility.\n\nFox News’ $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history involving a media company.\n\nThe deal was announced hours after the jury was sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court. Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.\n\nAttorneys representing Dominion Voting Systems, leave the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Del., after the defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News was settled just as the jury trial was set to begin, Tuesday, April 18, 2023. Julio Cortez/AP\n\n“The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media “trial of the century” before it could even begin.\n\nThe groundbreaking settlement “represents vindication and accountability,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said. “For our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts… Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.”\n\nThe right-wing network said in a statement that it “acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” referring to Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won’t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.\n\nThe $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though it is nearly 10 times the company’s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings.\n\nFox avoids painful six-week trial\n\nThe last-minute agreement means the closely watched case is over and won’t proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.\n\nFox lawyers leave the courthouse after Dominion Voting Systems and Fox settled a defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million, avoiding trial, over Fox's coverage of debunked election-rigging claims, in Delaware Superior Court, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. April 18, 2023. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nThe witness list included Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, his CEO son Lachlan Murdoch, and top Fox hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. But the lies were spread on-air anyway.\n\nRupert Murdoch thought the election denialism was “really crazy,” even as Fox personalities peddled those same claims to millions of viewers. Carlson said he “passionately” hates Donald Trump, whose presidency was a “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless” and “mind-blowingly nuts.”\n\nThese revelations generated months of blistering headlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. By settling now, Fox deprived Dominion a chance to further expose its dishonesty with a weeks-long trial.\n\n“This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards,” Fox said in a statement Tuesday. “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nFox News and Fox Corporation – its parent company, which was also a defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms.\n\nDramatic days in Delaware\n\nSpeculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a one-day delay to the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday.\n\nThe jury selection process wrapped up as planned Tuesday morning, and both sides prepped for opening statements. They even briefly tangled over objections to specific slides in their presentations. But when the proceedings didn’t promptly resume after lunch, the chances of a deal seemed to rise by the minute, even though the top lawyers from both sides sat in the courtroom, looking at their phones, and waiting.\n\nThe racially diverse jury of six men and six women was brought back into the court, ready for their front-row seat to a historic trial. But Davis, the judge, instead told the panel they helped spur a settlement.\n\n“Your presence here, short compared to what you thought, and uneventful in a certain sense, was extremely important,” Davis said. “Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.”\n\nMany on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself.\n\n“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court.\n\nWhile the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News’ shows after the 2020 election. That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isn’t expected anytime soon.\n\nFor its part, Dominion still has pending lawsuits against right-wing TV networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell. They all deny wrongdoing.\n\nCNN’s Liam Reilly and Danny Freeman contributed to this story.",

                    "snippet": "WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Fox News agreed Tuesday to pay Dominion Voting Systems nearly $800 million to avert a trial in the voting machine company’s lawsuit that would have exposed how the network promoted lies about the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe stunning settlement emerged just as opening statements were supposed to begin, abruptly ending a case that had embarrassed Fox News over several months and raised the possibility that network founder Rupert Murdoch and stars such as Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity would have to testify publicly.\n\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson told reporters outside a Delaware courthouse after Superior Court Judge Eric Davis announced the deal.\n\nOutside of the $787.5 million promised to Colorado-based Dominion, it was unclear what other consequences Fox would face. Fox acknowledged in a statement “the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” but no apology was offered.\n\n“We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” Fox said. Its lawyers and representatives offered no other comment or details about the settlement.\n\nAsked by a reporter whether there was “anything to this other than money,” Dominion CEO John Poulos did not answer.\n\nThe deal is a significant amount of money even for a company the size of Fox. It represents about one-quarter of the $2.96 billion the company reported earning last year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — a figure often used to approximate a company’s cash flow.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe settlement also follows a $965 million judgment issued last year against Alex Jones by a Connecticut jury for spreading false conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook school massacre.\n\nCoupled with other lawsuits in the pipeline, the agreement shows there is a real financial risk for conservative media that traffic in conspiracy theories. What remains unknown is how much of a deterrent this will be. Even as the Dominion case loomed this spring, Fox’s Tucker Carlson aired his alternate theories about what happened at the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nDominion had sued Fox for $1.6 billion , arguing that the top-rated news outlet damaged the company’s reputation by peddling phony conspiracy theories that claimed its equipment switched votes from former President Donald Trump to Democrat Joe Biden. Davis, in an earlier ruling, said it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations about Dominion aired on Fox by Trump allies were true.\n\nDominion set out to prove in the lawsuit that Fox acted with malice in airing allegations that it knew to be false , or with “reckless disregard” for the truth. It presented volumes of internal emails and text messages that showed Fox executives and personalities saying they knew the accusations were untrue, even as the falsehoods were aired on programs hosted by Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs and Jeannine Pirro.\n\nRecords released as part of the lawsuit showed that Fox aired the claims in part to win back viewers who were fleeing the network after it correctly called hotly contested Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden on election night. One Fox Corp. vice president called them “MIND BLOWINGLY NUTS.”\n\nDuring a deposition, Murdoch testified that he believed the 2020 election was fair and had not been stolen from Trump.\n\n“Fox knew the truth,” Dominion argued in court papers. “It knew the allegations against Dominion were ‘outlandish’ and ‘crazy’ and ‘ludicrous’ and ‘nuts.’ Yet it used the power and influence of its platform to promote that false story.”\n\nSeveral First Amendment experts said Dominion’s case was among the strongest they had ever seen. But there was real doubt about whether Dominion would be able to prove to a jury that people in a decision-making capacity at Fox could be held responsible for the network’s actions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDominion’s Nelson called the settlement “a tremendous victory” and noted that there are six more lawsuits pending regarding election claims.\n\n“We settled because it was about accountability,” Nelson said in an interview. “Our goals were to make sure that there was accountability for the lies, and to try to make our client right. And we accomplished both goals.”\n\nIt’s hard to tell what the deal will mean financially for Dominion. The company would not provide its most recent earnings, saying the figures were not public.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the trial, Davis significantly narrowed Fox’s potential line of defense, including nixing the network’s argument that it was merely airing newsworthy allegations. Newsworthiness is not a defense against defamation, he said.\n\nIn a March 31 ruling, he pointedly called out the network for airing falsehoods while noting that bogus election claims still persist more than two years after Trump lost his bid for reelection.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“The statements at issue were dramatically different than the truth,” Davis said in that ruling. “In fact, although it cannot be attributed directly to Fox’s statements, it is noteworthy that some Americans still believe the election was rigged.”\n\nIn its defense, Fox said it was obligated to report on a president who claimed that he had been cheated out of reelection.\n\n“We never reported those to be true,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said. “All we ever did was provide viewers the true fact that these were allegations that were being made.”\n\nDominion had sued both Fox News and its parent, Fox Corp, and said its business had been significantly damaged. Fox said the company grossly overestimated its losses, before agreeing to pay about half of what Dominion had asked for.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a 1964 case involving The New York Times, the U.S. Supreme Court limited the ability of public figures to sue for defamation. The court ruled that plaintiffs needed to prove that news outlets published or aired false material with “actual malice” — knowing such material was false or acting with a “reckless disregard” for whether or not it was true.\n\nThat has provided news organizations with stout protection against libel judgments. Yet the nearly six-decade legal standard has come under attack by some conservatives in recent years, including Trump and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who have argued for making it easier to win a libel case.\n\n“The larger importance of the settlement ... is that the high level of protection for news media in a defamation case remains intact for now,” said Doreen Weisenhaus, an instructor of media law at Northwestern University.\n\nIn documents released in recent months, Fox executives and anchors discussed how not to alienate the audience, many of whom believed Trump’s claims of fraud despite no evidence to back them up. Fox’s Tucker Carlson suggested a news reporter be fired for tweeting a fact check debunking the fraud claims.\n\nSome of the exhibits were simply embarrassing, such as scornful behind-the-scenes opinions about Trump, whose supporters form the core of the network’s viewers. Text exchanges revealed as part of the lawsuit show Carlson declaring, “I hate him passionately,” and saying that “we are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFox News announced the settlement on Neil Cavuto’s afternoon news show. “It’s a done deal,” he said. “It’s a settlement and for at least Fox, it appears to be over.”\n\nBut Fox’s legal problems may not be over.

Davis said in court Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIt is the largest publicly disclosed settlement for a defamation lawsuit in US history.\n\nDavis, who has been presiding over the case, previously decided to push back the start of the case one day, giving lawyers for both sides an extra day to devote to settlement discussions.\n\nThe settlement is a victory for Dominion, which no longer has to contend with the prospect of a six-week trial and potentially years of grueling appeals if it had won.\n\nBut it also means that Fox News's many detractors won't get to see the right-wing media network's biggest executives and stars — including Rupert Murdoch, Tucker Carlson, and Sean Hannity — grilled on the witness stand.\n\nFox News hosts will not be required to issue retractions or many any other statements under the terms of the agreement, a person familiar with its terms told Insider.\n\nIn a press conference after Davis announced the settlement, Justin Nelson, an attorney for Dominion, said the $787.5 million payout represented \"vindication and accountability.\"\n\n\"People across the political spectrum can and should disagree on issues even of the most profound importance,\" he said. \"For our democracy to endure for another 250 years and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts.\"\n\nDominion CEO John Poulos criticized Fox for broadcasting lies about the company and thanks election officials throughout the US.\n\n\"Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,\" he said. \"Nothing can ever make up for that.\"\n\nIn its own statement, Fox News said it was \"pleased to have reached a settlement\" which it claimed represented a commitment to journalistic standards.\n\n\"We acknowledge the Court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,\" a Fox spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \"This settlement reflects FOX's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.\"\n\nSettlement talks have been brewing\n\nOn Sunday night, Davis pushed back the trial's start from Monday to Tuesday. Several outlets reported that both sides were in settlement discussions.\n\nAt the same time, on the court docket, each side slung filings arguing over technical issues that could determine how much Dominion would be able to claim in damages in the trial.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the case still seemed headed to trial as Davis completed jury selection. Dominion and Fox each had about two dozen lawyers present in court.\n\nBut Davis extended the jurors' lunch break by more than two hours as he retreated to his chambers — beckoning attorneys from both parties to join him — and gave rise to more speculation among the journalists assembled in court that a settlement was imminent.\n\nDominion filed its lawsuit against Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corp., in March 2021. It alleged the network defamed it when its hosts Jeanine Pirro, Maria Bartiromo, and Lou Dobbs brought on conspiracy theorist lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell as guests.\n\nTrump hired Giuliani and Powell to challenge his loss in the 2020 election. The two spun a fantastical, false tale claiming Dominion — in cahoots with rival election technology company Smartmatic — rigged the election by switching votes from Trump to now-President Joe Biden.\n\nRudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell during a news conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters. AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin\n\nFox News hosts, Dominion alleged, either endorsed or didn't sufficiently push back against those claims when they invited Powell and Giuliani on their shows.\n\nDavis had already ruled it was \"CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,\" and that Dominion only had to prove Fox acted with \"actual malice\" — the legal standard for defamation cases involving public figures. Fox, for its part, claimed it was simply reporting the news and that its broadcasts were protected by the First Amendment. First Amendment experts overwhelmingly believed it was Dominion's case to lose.\n\nIn brief remarks on Tuesday afternoon, Davis thanked the jurors for their service and praised attorneys from both Fox and Dominion for their professionalism and the quality of their legal briefs.\n\n\"I've been on the bench since 2010, and I think this is the best lawyering I've ever had — ever,\" he said.\n\nFox News's secrets have already been spilled\n\nTwo years of litigation have already dealt Fox heavy blows.\n\nIn court filings leading up to the trial, Dominion shared excerpts from numerous depositions, texts, and emails from Fox's executives, hosts, and producers. They depicted a newsroom desperately trying to stay on Trump's good side while fending off competition from Newsmax, a further-right media network that more explicitly embraced his election lies. Fox News was more interested in protecting its viewership ratings than reporting the news, Dominion argued.\n\nInternal messages showed that Powell shared an email demonstrating her claims of election fraud relied in part on someone claiming to be a time-traveling headless ghost. Carlson, Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and multiple producers all privately believed she had taken leave of her senses, though they didn't say as much on air and were slow to accept Biden's electoral victory anyway. People close to Murdoch believed Giuliani, for his part, was frequently drunk. Ingraham called him an \"idiot.\"\n\nCarlson — the Fox News host with the highest primetime ratings — said in texts that he \"passionately\" hated Trump and thought him a \"demonic force\" who nonetheless had the capacity to \"destroy\" the network. He and Hannity tried to get a Fox News reporter fired when she fact-checked Trump on Twitter.\n\n\"We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights,\" Carlson wrote as he lost the 2020 election. \"I truly can't wait.\"\n\nRepresentatives of Fox News arrive at the justice center for the Dominion Voting Systems' defamation lawsuit against Fox News, in Wilmington, Delaware. AP Photo/Julio Cortez\n\nMurdoch had recognized that Fox News's audience was in Trump's thrall and said it \"would have been stupid\" to alienate them. After the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol, he said it was time to make Trump a \"non-person.\"\n\nThroughout this period, Dominion sent Fox 3,600 fact-checking messages, which it said were widely circulated throughout the network. One executive \"received Dominion's fact check so many times that on November 14 he wrote a colleague: 'I have it tattooed on my body at this point,'\" Dominion lawyers wrote in a filing.\n\nAfter being told that Dobbs ran false information about election fraud on one of his shows, one producer responded, \"Jesus Christ. Does anyone do a fucking simple google search or read emails?\" according to a filing. A top executive said \"the North Koreans do a more nuanced show\" than Dobbs.\n\nAs for airing ads from Mike Lindell — the MyPillow CEO who shared an even more outlandish conspiracy theory about Dominion and Smartmatic than the one pushed by Powell and Giuliani — Murdoch agreed in a deposition that he was happy to take his money.\n\nThe case has also been beset by late twists. The judge has admonished Fox's lawyers for withholding certain discovery evidence until right before the start of the trial. And Abby Grossberg, a former producer for Carlson and Bartiromo, alleged that Fox's attorneys coached her answers in a deposition given for Dominion's lawsuit.\n\n\"They're activists, not journalists,\" Grossberg said of Fox News producers in court filings.\n\nFox is not out of the woods\n\nThe prospect of shareholder lawsuits may complicate any payout to Dominion. One such lawsuit, already working its way through Delaware Chancery Court, alleges Fox Corp. breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fox News to broadcast election lies and expose it to litigation from Smartmatic and Dominion.\n\nA settlement, First Amendment experts say, may also make Fox the target of future defamation lawsuits from plaintiffs who believe they'll get a payout. Murdoch already has a record of settling lawsuits: A Washington Post analysis found his companies paid out nearly $750 million over the past 13 years to settle legal claims, including sexual harassment and hacking allegations.\n\nA potentially greater risk is a case from Smartmatic, which asks for $2.7 billion in damages. That lawsuit, filed in New York state court, also names Giuliani as a defendant. (The company's lawsuit against Powell is progressing through a court in Washington, DC, for jurisdictional reasons.) Court filings indicate that Smartmatic has drawn on some of the evidence in the Dominion lawsuit for its own case.\n\n\"Dominion's litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox's disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest,\" Smartmatic attorney J. Erik Connolly said in a statement Tuesday. \"Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy.\"\n\nParticipants seen holding a banner outside Fox News HQ. Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nDominion and Smartmatic both have a passel of other pending lawsuits against Newsmax and another right-wing media outlet, One America News, as well as a number of conspiracy theorist influencers.\n\n\"Money is accountability, and we got that today from Fox, but we're not done yet,\" Dominion attorney Stephen Shackelford said Tuesday. \"We have some other people who've got accountability coming toward them.\"\n\nAhead of the settlement Tuesday, there were some minor signs of drama in the case.\n\nDavis appointed a special master to investigate potential \"discovery issues\" with Fox News withholding potential evidence in the case. One juror, moments after he was sworn in, said aloud \"I can't do it.\" The judge took him aside, excused him, and designated an alternate with the consent of both parties a short while later.\n\nAt 8:55 a.m., five minutes before the day's court session began, officers escorted out a Fox News spokesperson sitting in the back of the courtroom who had taken a photo and instructed her to delete it. Davis reminded the attorneys and throng of reporters seated in the room to abide by his orders forbidding any form of broadcast.\n\n\"You have to abide by the official order. If you don't, there will be consequences,\" he said. \"It's not a joke.\"\n\n\"We have people in the courtroom who are moles,\" he added, to loud laughter from the attorneys and nervous chuckles from some journalists.\n\nIn the afternoon, after Davis announced the parties reached a settlement, gasps could be heard in the courtroom. Journalists ran outside the courtroom to file their stories.\n\nWhile Dominion's team gave a press conference, Fox's lawyers walked away and declined to comment.",

                    "snippet": "Fox News settles blockbuster defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nFox News and its parent company Fox Corp. have struck a deal averting a trial in the blockbuster defamation suit filed by the election tech company Dominion Voting Systems over spurious claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nJudge Eric Davis of the Delaware Superior Court announced the settlement from the bench on Tuesday afternoon ahead of the trial's scheduled start.\n\nThe parties settled for $787,500,000 — about half of Dominion's original $1.6 billion ask.\n\nThe amount \"represents vindication and accountability,\" said Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson. \"Lies have consequences.\"\n\nDominion CEO John Poulos told reporters, \"Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees and the customers that we serve. Nothing can ever make up for that. Throughout this process, we have sought accountability,\" he said. \"Truthful reporting in the media is essential to our democracy.\"\n\nFox News released a statement shortly after a settlement was announced.\n\n\"We acknowledge the Court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,\" the statement said. \"This settlement reflects FOX's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.\"\n\n\"As much evidence as we've seen, there still is plenty more that hasn't been made public. In a trial, the documents and statements that have been redacted, which are likely to constitute some of the most damning evidence against Fox, would have been revealed,\" said Tom Wienner, a retired Michigan corporate litigator who has been following the case closely at NPR's request.\n\n\"Dominion started this case because Fox's defamatory statements had severely damaged its reputation,\" Wienner added. \"By largely trying its case in the court of public opinion, Dominion has gone a long way toward restoring its good name. In the process, of course, Fox's own reputation has been seriously undermined.\"\n\nA settlement was always on the table\n\nPast the ill will, past the statements that were clearly wrong in real time, past the inflammatory arguments and the soaring declarations of constitutional principle, a settlement always loomed as the logical resolution of the legal clash.\n\nDominion Voting Systems alleged that Fox stars, executives, journalists and guests defamed the election tech company for segments in which wild and spurious conspiracies held it had switched votes for then-President Donald Trump to Democratic challenger Joe Biden.\n\nDominion's legal team pursued a \"to the pain\" strategy, intending to inflict maximum discomfort for Fox and its proprietors in order to secure as big a payout and as public an apology from Fox News as possible. For Fox and its controlling owners, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, it was worth the cost to pay for the spectacle to go away.\n\nFor Fox, what evidence dribbled out in court hearings and court documents piled embarrassment upon embarrassment upon disgrace:\n\nFox News chief executive Suzanne Scott warned her colleagues against running fact-checking segments by the network's own reporters debunking lies about election fraud, even as it gave such bogus claims acres of prime real estate.\n\nMany Fox hosts and executives didn't believe conspiracy theories — but didn't stop them\n\nPrimetime stars Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity privately trashed the people who lied about Dominion on their network's airwaves and yet also trashed the reporters who sought to hold them accountable for those lies.\n\nFox founder Rupert Murdoch — who, under oath, called himself a newsman at heart — advocated going slow in confronting Fox's pro-Trump viewers with unwelcome news in order to protect the franchise.\n\nHannity didn't believe \"for one second\" the lies being peddled by Trump and on Fox itself, even though, as Murdoch put it, the star endorsed them \"a bit.\"\n\nHost Maria Bartiromo put on an attorney spinning pro-Trump conspiracy theories and insinuating, without evidence, fraud by Dominion on the basis of a memo whose author, a Minnesota artist, called her own allegations \"pretty wackadoodle.\"\n\nJudge Davis had signaled his deep skepticism over Fox's defense.\n\nBefore the jury trial phase of the case had even commenced, Davis ruled in Dominion's favor on key points. Fox had argued Dominion's lawsuit violated free speech provisions in the First Amendment by seeking to hold the network accountable for what it accurately reported that newsworthy figures, including a sitting president, were saying.\n\nJudge Davis found that the statements on Fox's shows were false and had defamed the election tech company.\n\nThe judge, known for his even-keeled demeanor on his bench over the years, repeatedly lost his equanimity with Fox's blue-ribbon legal team, as the trial neared.\n\nDavis warned Fox attorneys that he felt misled once he learned, just a week before opening arguments, that Rupert Murdoch held the title \"executive chairman\" at Fox News — suggesting he had more agency over the network's coverage and tone than it allowed. (Fox said the title was an honorific without meaning for the network's founder.) Davis also questioned whether Fox had withheld other material and information from Dominion's attorneys and the court, moving to appoint a special master to investigate the conduct of Fox's lawyers.\n\nAnd Davis warned Fox attorneys \"don't make me look like an idiot,\" after they asked that the 92-year-old Murdoch not be subjected to the rigors of being forced to travel to Wilmington to testify in person. Davis noted Murdoch had just announced in the gossip pages of his own New York Post the intention to split time among his four homes in Montana, Los Angeles, New York City and London with his new bride-to-be. That Murdoch called off the wedding, which was to have been his fifth, shortly after, did not appear to mitigate Davis' irritation.\n\nPaying to make the bleeding stop\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nNone of this made for an auspicious start to the trial for Fox or the Murdochs.\n\nAnd so the Murdochs decided to pay nearly $800 million to make the bleeding stop. Had they not done so, Rupert would have likely been subject to questioning in court. Network executives would have been forced to pick between testifying that they had no idea that their own reporters had debunked the Trump campaign's false claims of election fraud or that they knew but allowed stars to give them credibility in front of millions of viewers.\n\nThe Murdochs have paid before. They agreed to settlements in excess of $900 million over allegations of fraud and anti-competitive practices against News Corp's lesser-known marketing business, News America; they paid hundreds of millions of dollars in a massive phone and email hacking scandal involving their British tabloids; and they paid roughly $200 million to ensure further details of allegations of widespread sexual harassment at Fox News were not aired in open court.\n\nThe network also paid the family of the slain Democratic party aide Seth Rich an undisclosed settlement worth millions of dollars just before Hannity and former Fox Business host Lou Dobbs were set to be questioned by the Riches' attorneys under oath.\n\nSimilarly, executives at the Walt Disney Co. and ABC breathed a sigh of relief after settling a case in 2017, in which ABC News had referred to a kind of processed beef as \"pink slime.\" That's because the amount parent company Disney paid — $177 million — was a fraction of its possible $5.7 billion exposure under South Dakota law. ABC did not retract the story.\n\nWhen it comes to defamation, says Jane Kirtley, a former executive director of The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, there are two elements for media outlets in deciding to settle, one immediate and one grander.\n\nBroadly speaking, she says, media organizations want to sidestep any chance for a judge or appellate court to revisit the very high standard of proving \"actual malice,\" established in a landmark 1964 ruling in a case involving The New York Times. The law currently favors news organizations. Yet several U.S. Supreme Court Justices have expressed an interest in altering or reforming that standard.\n\n\"There's always a risk that mischief will be done,\" says Kirtley, a noted advocate for press rights. \"If you can make the case go away, that's a win.\"\n\nThe more specific concern, Kirtley says, involves a calculation: Can Fox and the Murdochs stomach a continuing parade of mortifying revelations, even if they do not affect the ultimate outcome of the trial?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nAiring baseless accusations after Biden beats Trump\n\nOn election night, Fox News's decision desk projected that Democratic presidential nominee Biden would win the pivotal state of Arizona. Trump and his advisers waged an intense effort to get the network to reverse the call. The network and the Murdochs stood by it.\n\nYet in ensuing days, viewers peeled away. Major Fox News stars such as Dobbs, Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro embraced the claims that Dominion machines switched Trump votes to Biden and other far-fetched accounts of voting fraud. Along with Hannity and Carlson, they gave Trump allies the airtime to make similar claims.\n\nAnchors such as Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum complained about the blowback from Trump's inner circle and their own viewers and asked whether such projections could take audience sentiment into account in the future.\n\nTwo senior political editors involved in the projection of Arizona — Washington Managing Editor Bill Sammon and political director Chris Stirewalt — were forced out at the urging of Rupert Murdoch. Fox called Sammon's departure a retirement and Stirewalt's part of a larger restructuring. Neither characterization was true.\n\nDobbs would be fired the day after a $2.7 billion defamation suit was filed against Fox by Smartmatic, another voting tech company falsely accused on Fox of participating in defrauding Trump of victory. (Smartmatic was only active in Los Angeles County during the 2020 elections, according to company officials and its lawsuit remains pending in federal court.) Fox said Dobbs' hasty exit was part of a post-election rejiggering.\n\nOther journalists were laid off. And Fox News turned over two hours of evening programming that had been reserved for news shows — at 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. — to conservative talk show host Jesse Watters and conservative comedian Greg Gutfeld. Pirro was named a co-host of the top-rated weekday show \"The Five\" – a promotion from her weekend hosting slot. The two news shows were pushed to the outer fringe slots — MacCallum's news show to 3 p.m., Shannon Bream to midnight.\n\nFox personalities including Pirro and Mark Levin ginned up viewer anger ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, rally headlined by Trump at the Washington Mall to protest the scheduled congressional certification of Biden's victory. When the U.S. Capitol was violently besieged that day by Trump's supporters, Fox responded shakily. Fox's Carlson claimed that the attack on Congress was harmless and also simultaneously arranged by Antifa and the FBI. There is no evidence on which to base such claims.\n\nWinning back viewers alienated by Fox's election night Arizona call\n\nThe effect, as Dominion alleged in its suit, represented an intense effort to win back voters alienated by that original Arizona call for Biden. Each new phase of the case — from discovery to motions detailing some of the findings through depositions and a review of millions of documents to the cross-examination of witnesses in the trial portion — brought the potential for greater scrutiny of Fox and reputational damage.\n\nDominion attached a gaudy price tag to the damages it sought. But it might not have prevailed in court.\n\n\"In these high-stakes defamation suits,\" says Rutgers law professor Ronald Chen, an authority on media law, \"very often litigation is not the way for either of them to get complete satisfaction.\"\n\n\"By law, there's a winner and a loser,\" Chen says. \"And where there's a high risk for both the plaintiff and the defendant, settlement is very often the way both sides are both able to claim some type of victory.\"\n\nChen notes it is hard for plaintiffs suing news organizations to surpass the legal requirement of actual malice — that is, proving the news outlet either knew what it was broadcasting was false and harmful, or had grounds to know it and acted with \"willful disregard\" of the truth.\n\n\"Obviously if it were established, that would put any media organization's reputation in utter tatters,\" Chen adds.\n\nA world grounded in cynicism and hostility\n\nEven in settling and sidestepping an adverse verdict, Fox's reputation among its peers has already been shattered.\n\nWhat Dominion uncovered in the investigative part of the suit — what's called discovery — revealed a world grounded in cynicism, hostility. From the top down, the Murdochs and Fox created a network defined by a relentless pursuit of ratings that placed profit above politics, and partisan advantage above any sense of journalistic obligation. The public's right to know the truth rarely earned a hearing.\n\nFox's chief media host and correspondent, Howard Kurtz, barely touched on the case. He finally told viewers he had been forbidden from covering it by his corporate bosses.\n\nWhen Baier, Fox's chief political anchor, repeatedly pitched devoting an hour-long special to debunking myths of election fraud, executives effectively ignored him: Baier did not receive a firm response.\n\nAnchor Shepard Smith left the network in 2019 after being attacked on the air by Carlson and receiving no public backing from Fox. Wallace left Fox in late 2021 after Carlson's lies about the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Baier raised objections to Carlson's special programs championing the insurrectionists. But Baier protested quietly, in private. And he stuck around.\n\nFox is not just any media organization.\n\nWere it to simply have apologized — as the smaller right-wing network Newsmax did after its personalities made similar claims about Dominion — Fox would have acknowledged its biggest stars had been wrong to present Trump's claims of election fraud — and that they, the viewers, had been wrong to believe them.\n\nThe Murdochs may have perceived it worth nearly any price to avoid such a public humiliation.",

(Eduardo Munoz/Reuters)\n\nAt a press conference outside the courthouse, attorneys for Dominion said they’d reached an agreement with Fox’s lawyers to settle the suit for $787.5 million — less than the $1.6 billion in damages Dominion had been seeking.\n\n“The truth matters,\" Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said in a news conference outside the courthouse after the announcement. \"Lies have consequences.”\n\nIn a statement, Fox News said the network is \"pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.\"\n\nThe case centered on a number of false claims and baseless conspiracy theories that Fox News hosts and guests made on air in the wake of the 2020 presidential election, which alleged that Dominion Voting Systems, an election technology company, had rigged voting machines to help Joe Biden steal the election from then-President Donald Trump.\n\nIn pretrial filings, Dominion revealed that it had obtained a wealth of evidence, including emails, text messages and deposition testimony, revealing that top Fox executives and hosts had privately cast doubt on Trump’s claims about rigged Dominion machines. Various Fox News personalities, from hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity to Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott, and even Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, were expected to be called to testify at the trial.\n\nIn the landmark 1964 ruling New York Times v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court set a particularly high bar for public figures who seek to bring libel cases against media organizations, requiring them to prove that defamatory statements were made with “actual malice” or that the defendant knew they were false at the time or acted with “reckless disregard” for the truth.\n\nThis standard, which is extremely difficult to meet, is meant to give media outlets freedom to make mistakes while reporting on newsworthy events, as long as they don’t do so deliberately. Fox has argued that its coverage of Trump’s voter fraud allegations should be covered by the First Amendment, accusing Dominion in a statement of taking “an extreme view of defamation law that would stop the media in its tracks.”\n\nAhead of the trial, Judge Davis poked holes in Fox’s defense, ruling that Dominion had successfully proved that the statements in question were false, meaning that a jury would have to decide only whether Fox should be liable for broadcasting them.",

Subscribe to more newsletters here\n\nDetails of the deal were not immediately disclosed, but Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said the settlement was reached at around $787.5 million.\n\n“The truth matters,” Nelson said during a press conference outside the packed Delaware courtroom. “Money is accountability and we got that today.”\n\nNelson did not say if an on-air apology or retraction would be coming from the network when asked repeatedly by reporters.\n\n“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my Company, our employees, and our customers. Nothing can ever make up for that,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said.\n\n“Throughout this process, we have sought accountability and believe the evidence brought to light through this case underscores the consequences of spreading and endorsing lies.”\n\nIn a statement, Fox News Media said the network was “pleased” to reach a settlement and that it acknowledged “the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.”\n\n“We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” the statement read.\n\nDominion initially sued Fox in 2021, contending the network knowingly aired false information about the voting machine company’s software that was being promoted by Trump and his allies.\n\nThe settlement figure falls short of the $1.6 billion the company had been demanding in its lawsuit. But the $787.5 million is far more than the $80 million valuation for which Dominion was acquired by a private equity group in 2018, according to a Fox filing.\n\nDominion said in an unsealed report that it sustained $921 million in damage to its business, $88 million in lost profits and $600 million in lost future profits due to Fox’s coverage.\n\nA recent Fox Corporation filing showed the company had about $4.1 billion “of cash and cash equivalents” at the end of 2022, according to The New York Times.\n\nInternal communications and depositions given to Dominion’s lawyers in recent months show top hosts and executives at Fox casting doubt internally on Trump’s claims while worrying over how fact checks might alienate the network’s audience.\n\nFox had argued in court filings and public statements that the comments of its employees made public by Dominion had been “cherry picked” while arguing the allegations made by Trump and his associates were newsworthy, so the network had a journalistic duty to present them to its audience — the widest in cable television.\n\nDominion’s lawsuit focuses on a number of claims made by Trump allies on Fox, including wild statements made by attorney Sidney Powell and others that Dominion had used software “at the direction” of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to swing the election against Trump.\n\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis, who had been overseeing the case, earlier this month in sending the suit to trial ruled that the statements made by Trump’s associates in question were false. He also rejected Fox’s attempts to throw out Dominion’s claims ahead of bringing the case before a jury based on First Amendment privileges.\n\nThe revelations from the lawsuit so far have already created a smattering of embarrassing headlines for the cable network. Top host Tucker Carlson said in text messages that he hated Trump “passionately.”\n\nCarlson and fellow prime-time host Sean Hannity had talked about getting Fox reporters fired for fact checking Trump. And Fox’s top talent is shown in text messages privately insulting Powell over the claims at the center of the suit.\n\nDuring pre-trial hearings, Davis had indicated he would not stop Dominion from calling Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of Fox Corp., to testify as a live in-person witness, potentially setting the stage for what would be a dramatic and unprecedented moment in American media history.\n\nSome of Fox’s competitors were quick to jump on the news, with CNN’s Jake Tapper laughing while reading its statement on the settlement and calling it “one of the ugliest and most embarrassing moments in the history of journalism.”\n\nUpdated 6:21 p.m.",

                    "snippet": "After an hours-long delay, Judge Eric Davis entered the courtroom just before 4pm and dismissed the jurors, saying, 'The parties have resolved their case'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA $787.5 million settlement has been reached in Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6billion defamation case against Fox News.\n\nAfter an hours-long delay, Judge Eric Davis entered the courtroom just before 4pm and thanked the jurors as he dismissed them with the simple words, 'The parties have resolved their case.'\n\nAfter the jury was dismissed attorneys for both parties thanked the court. Judge Davis in turn complimented their professionalism throughout.\n\nThis brings an end to the contentious case that saw the voting machine company accuse the cable news network of 'giving life' to a 'manufactured storyline' about voter fraud after the 2020 election.\n\nDominion lawyer Justin Nelson said in a news conference that Fox is paying $787,500,000 to settle the defamation case, a number which he says 'represents vindication and accountability.'\n\n'Lies have consequences,' he said.\n\nThe network said in a statement, 'We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.\n\n'This settlement reflects Fox's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.'\n\nDominion lawyer Justin Nelson said in a news conference that Fox is paying $787,500,000 to settle the defamation case, a number which he says 'represents vindication and accountability'\n\nA settlement has been reached in Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6billion defamation case against Fox News today\n\nFox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch was expected to testify in the trial against his Fox News - which was accused of peddling conspiracy theories regarding election fraud after Trump's defeat in 2020\n\nSpeaking directly after the settlement was announced, a source close to the Dominion team told DailyMail.com, 'It was the right thing for the client, but we were ready to try the case.'\n\nJudge Davis said while announcing the conclusion of the case, 'I've been on the bench since 2010 and I think this is the best ordering I've had.\n\n'The briefing, the professionalism, It's difficult stuff. I've never had as good a lawyering from here in the 13 years - the quality of the briefing, the ability of attorneys to answer questions, the amount of work load that you've done.\n\n'I'd be proud to be your judge in the future.'\n\nOpening statements had been due to start directly after lunch at 1.30pm. But, after only a fleeting appearance during which he did not address anyone, Judge Eric Davis left the courtroom.\n\nTime ticked on and with no jury seated, no judge on the bench and no explanation, the soft murmur of speculation from the gallery rose to a crescendo.\n\nJustin Nelson, lead counsel for Dominion, and Dan Webb, his Fox counterpart, were called into Judge Davis's chambers at 2.58pm.\n\nBarely two minutes later they were back in the court, their faces giving nothing away.\n\nThis morning Dominion told the judge they needed 1hr 15 minutes for their opening statement while Fox had requested one hour 30 minutes.\n\nApproximately 20 counsels for Dominion shuffled into the long front bench to the left of the gallery in the morning.\n\nFox News attorney Daniel Webb is seen leaving the courthouse Tuesday after reaching a settlement\n\nA roughly equal number of their counterparts for Fox squeezed into two shorter pews to the right.\n\nA further 20 attorneys - ten apiece - took their seats in the tables reserved for counsel in the court's well until the front portion of the chamber heaved with lawyers.\n\nPerhaps in a hint of how fiercely this action has already been fought, the objections from both sides were raised before jury selection was complete.\n\nCounsel for Dominion and Fox each raised objections to slides and content in their counterpart's opening.\n\nAccording to Fox's lead counsel Dan Webb, Dominion's objections if sustained would 'cripple' their presentation.\n\nApparently already irritated by the day's delay and the specter of proceedings being further obstructed, Judge Davis informed the court that he would deal with objections ahead of openings but warned, 'We only have so much time. We have six weeks and I'm going to keep it strict. I'm not going to give you an extra day. This will start to count against you.'\n\nDiscussing it further, he told both sides to see if they could sort it out among themselves as he didn't want to 'micromanage' and didn't think it appropriate.\n\nIn a dry and stern warning, he went onto tell the court that there are 'certain rules in the courtroom – my rules.' Anyone violating them or failing to follow the instruction of the capitol police or bailiffs would, he said, 'be in big trouble. Even if you're right.'\n\nThe legal team representing Fox News is seen arriving this morning at the Leonard Williams Justice Center\n\nApproximately 20 counsels for Fox were seen arriving to court holding boxes of documents\n\nOpening statements in Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6B defamation suit against Fox News begin today in Delaware Superior Court. A truck is seen driving in front of the courthouse this morning\n\nThe trial has been widely viewed as a test of whether Fox's coverage crossed the line between ethical journalism and the heedless pursuit of ratings, as Dominion alleges and Fox denies\n\nFinal jury selection, which had been delayed along with the start of the trial from Monday, took just over an hour with 12 jurors and 12 alternates chosen from an already slimmed down pool of 58.\n\nIt was a sedate and tedious process with no questions asked as a group of 12 was brought in and seated in the jury box. Instead, an officer of the court read from a list of already agreed numbers – preemptory strikes from both sides – and dismissed potential jurors one by one without explanation.\n\nAs each one left, their seat was refilled by another candidate. Bit by bit the profile of the potential twelve rippled with change until it was settled: an even split of men and women, seven black, five white.\n\nThe 12 alternates were seated and affirmed in a similar fashion.\n\nIn a moment of drama minutes after the jury were seated an alternate raised his hand and told the court 'Sir I can't do this. I've been up all night. I can't do this.'\n\nAfter a brief discussion with the judge and counsel the juror was dismissed and another alternate seated and sworn in.\n\nThe jurors and alternates will, Judge Davis told them, 'Have to fight human nature' and it will be the hardest thing they have to do.\n\n'You are going to want to talk about this [case],' he told them. 'You can't.'\n\nNor can they consult the internet, social media or be in the presence of anyone discussing the case. 'The key,' according to Judge Davis, 'is don't compromise yourself.'\n\nDominion claims Fox defamed the long-established voting firm by questioning its technology and methods after Donald Trump's November 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.\n\nJury selection in what shaped as the most-anticipated defamation trial in America was expected to conclude Monday before opening statements but Judge Davis on Sunday announced he was delaying the start 24 hours.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Delaware Superior Court, accuses Fox of 'giving life' to a 'manufactured storyline about election fraud' in its coverage of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nMany legal experts are surprised Fox and Dominion have not already reached an out-of-court settlement, although they can at any time.\n\nThe media giant contends the $1.6 billion damages claim is a wild overestimate while the voting company has been accused of trying to inflict maximum embarrassment by exposing the network's internal communications following the election.\n\nFox Corp chairman, Rupert Murdoch, was expected to be one of the first witnesses called before a parade of executives and on-air hosts, including Carlson, Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro.\n\nThe evidence includes recordings of Rudy Giuliani, former President Trump's lawyer, saying in pre-taped Fox appearances that he did not have any evidence to back up the false allegations of election rigging by Dominion in the 2020 race that are at the heart of the lawsuit.\n\nThe recordings were made by a former Fox employee who is currently suing the network.\n\nFox defamed the voting firm by questioning their technology and methods after Trump lost to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, Dominion claims\n\nThe voting company says the claims were part of a calculated bid by the network to 'lure viewers back' after they lost loyal fans because they were the first to declare that Trump had lost the state of Arizona.\n\nDominion, which was founded in 2002 and had, until 2020, operated largely unknown in 28 states in America said 'Fox endorsed, repeated and broadcast a series of verifiably false yet devastating lies about Dominion.'\n\nThese included claims that the company committed election fraud by rigging the 2020 presidential election, that its software and algorithms manipulated vote counts, that it was owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for former president Hugo Chavez, and that it paid 'kickbacks' to government officials who used its machines in the 2020 election.\n\nDominion claims Fox knew these claims were false but 'recklessly disregarded the truth,' as its hosts including Hannity, Pirro, Carlson, Lou Dobbs, and Maria Bartiromo, gave it oxygen.\n\nThe suit slams the network for allowing guests such as Sidney Powell, a lawyer denounced by the Trump team, Giuliani and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell on air to peddle conspiracy theories regarding election fraud unchallenged and unchecked.\n\nDominion's lawyers allege the false claims were promoted on Fox's news channels and online to its 80million subscribers ensuring the 'lies' went viral as people tweeted and retweeted them and that, ultimately, they were seen by billions.\n\nThe voting company says it lost millions in unrenewed state contracts as a result and anger generated by claims of a 'stolen election' put company personnel in physical danger which required $600,000 in additional security measures.\n\nFox News hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, and other on-air stars, were deposed in the case last year. The lawsuit claims the hosts helped perpetuate election fraud lies on air\n\nJeanine Pirro interviewing Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, who is also being sued by Dominion in a separate lawsuit. They are pictured on November 14, 2020\n\nThe suit also slams the network for allowing guests such as former New York mayor and Trump cohort, Rudy Giuliani and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell on air to peddle conspiracy theories about voter fraud unchallenged and unchecked\n\nFox Corp, which reported nearly $14 billion in annual revenue last year, said the lawsuit was a threat to press freedom and the $1.6 billion figure unrealistic and based on flawed economic modeling.\n\n'While Dominion has pushed irrelevant and misleading information to generate headlines, Fox News remains steadfast in protecting the rights of a free press,' Fox said in a statement.\n\nFox had argued that coverage of the vote-rigging claims was inherently newsworthy and protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of press freedom.\n\nJudge Davis rejected that argument in a ruling last month on both parties' competing motions for summary judgment.\n\nFox said Dominion cannot pin actual malice on the individuals whom Dominion says were responsible for the defamatory statements.\n\nThe network said Dominion must prove that a 'superior officer' at the network or its parent company 'ordered, participated in, or ratified' wrongdoing.\n\nTexts and emails revealed as part of the litigation appear to indicate that several people at Fox had doubts about the election fraud claims.\n\nCarlson, in a text to host Laura Ingraham in November 2020, said 'Sidney Powell is lying by the way. I caught her. It's insane.'\n\nIn a later text he wrote: 'It's unbelievably offensive to me. Our viewers are good people, and they believe it.'\n\nIn another text political correspondent Bret Baier wrote, 'There is NO evidence of fraud.'\n\nMurdoch himself has also conceded that some Fox hosts, 'endorsed' the 'false notion' that the 2020 election was stolen and that he personally could have done more to prevent claims from airing.\n\nBut lawyers for the network maintain that there is no evidence of a high-level conspiracy to peddle a falsehood, or that Murdoch and his colleagues were, 'reckless with the truth.'",

                    "snippet": "WILMINGTON, Del. — Fox and Dominion Voting Systems reached a $787 million settlement Tuesday in the voting machine company’s defamation lawsuit, averting a trial in a case that exposed how the top-rated network chased viewers by promoting lies about the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said in a news conference outside the courthouse after a judge announced the deal.\n\nDominion had asked for $1.6 billion in arguing that Fox had damaged its reputation by helping peddle phony conspiracy theories about its equipment switching votes from former President Donald Trump to Democrat Joe Biden. Fox said the amount greatly overstated the value of the Colorado-based company.\n\nThe resolution in Delaware Superior Court follows a recent ruling by Judge Eric Davis in which he allowed the case to go to trial while emphasizing it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations about Dominion aired on Fox by Trump allies were true.\n\nIn a statement issued shortly after the announcement, Fox News said the network acknowledged \"the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.” It did not respond to an inquiry asking for elaboration.\n\nGet the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\n\nInquiries to Dominion and Fox Corp. were not immediately returned.\n\nRecords released as part of the lawsuit showed how Fox hosts and executives did not believe the claims by Trump’s allies but aired them anyway, in part to win back viewers who were fleeing the network after it correctly called hotly contested Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden on election night.\n\nThe settlement, if formally accepted by the judge, will end a case that has proven a major embarrassment for Fox News. If the case had gone to trial, it also would have presented one of the sternest tests to a libel standard that has protected media organizations for more than half a century.\n\nSeveral First Amendment experts had said Dominion’s case was among the strongest they had ever seen. Still, there was real doubt about whether Dominion would be able to prove to a jury that people in a decision-making capacity at Fox could be held responsible for the network’s airing of the falsehoods.\n\nDominion accused Fox of defaming it by repeatedly airing, in the weeks after the 2020 presidential election, false allegations by Trump allies that its machines and the software they used had flipped votes to Biden — even as many at the network doubted the claims and disparaged those who were making them.\n\nThe company sued both Fox News and its parent, Fox Corp., and said its business had been significantly damaged.\n\nDuring a deposition, Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who founded the network, testified that he believed the 2020 election was fair and had not been stolen from Trump.\n\n“Fox knew the truth,” Dominion argued in court papers. “It knew the allegations against Dominion were ‘outlandish’ and ‘crazy’ and ‘ludicrous’ and ‘nuts.’ Yet it used the power and influence of its platform to promote that false story.”\n\nIn his March 31 summary judgment ruling, Davis pointedly called out the news organization for airing falsehoods while noting how the bogus election claims persist, 2 1/2 years after Trump lost his bid for reelection.\n\n“The statements at issue were dramatically different than the truth,” Davis said in that ruling. “In fact, although it cannot be attributed directly to Fox’s statements, it is noteworthy that some Americans still believe the election was rigged.”\n\nIn its defense, Fox said it was obligated to report on the most newsworthy of stories — a president claiming that he had been cheated out of reelection.\n\n“We never reported those to be true,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said. “All we ever did was provide viewers the true fact that these were allegations that were being made.”\n\nFox said Dominion had argued that the network was obligated to suppress the allegations or denounce them as false.\n\n“Freedom of speech and of the press would be illusory if the prevailing side in a public controversy could sue the press for giving a forum to the losing side,” Fox said in court papers.\n\nIn a 1964 case involving The New York Times, the U.S. Supreme Court limited the ability of public figures to sue for defamation. The court ruled that plaintiffs needed to prove that news outlets published or aired false material with “actual malice” — knowing such material was false or acting with a “reckless disregard” for whether or not it was true.\n\nThat has provided news organizations with stout protection against libel judgments. Yet the nearly six-decade legal standard has come under attack by some conservatives in recent years, including Trump and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who have argued for making it easier to win a libel case.\n\nTwo Republican-nominated Supreme Court justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have publicly expressed interest in revisiting the protection.\n\nDominion’s lawyers argued that Fox made a deliberate decision to repeatedly air the false claims to appeal to viewers. They allowed guests to falsely claim that the company had rigged the election, flipped large numbers of votes to Biden through a secret algorithm, was owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chavez, the late president, and bribed government officials.\n\n“What they did to get viewers back was start this new narrative that the election had been stolen and that Dominion was the thief,” Dominion lawyer Rodney Smolla said during a March hearing.\n\nA mountain of evidence — released in the form of deposition transcripts, internal memos and emails from the time — was damaging to Fox even if some of it was only tangentially related to the libel argument.\n\nDominion has pointed to text and email messages in which Fox insiders discounted and sometimes overtly mocked the vote manipulation claims. One Fox Corp. vice president called them “MIND BLOWINGLY NUTS.”\n\nMuch of the material showed a network effectively terrified of its audience after its election night declaration that Biden had won Arizona. The race call infuriated Trump and many viewers who supported him.\n\nOne of Fox’s top news anchors, Bret Baier, noted the audience’s anger and suggested rescinding the call, even awarding the state to Trump.\n\n“We don’t want to antagonize Trump further,” Murdoch said in a Nov. 16 memo.\n\nBiden narrowly won Arizona, but two executives responsible for the accurate election night call lost their jobs because of it two months later. In an internal memo, Murdoch talked in mid-November about firing them.\n\nFox executives and anchors discussed how not to alienate the audience, many of whom believed Trump’s claims of fraud despite no evidence to back them up. Fox’s Tucker Carlson suggested a news reporter be fired for tweeting a fact check debunking the fraud claims.\n\nSome of the exhibits were simply embarrassing, such as scornful behind-the-scenes opinions about Trump, whose supporters form the core of the network’s viewers. Text exchanges revealed as part of the lawsuit show Carlson declaring, “I hate him passionately,” and saying that “we are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.”",

By a large margin, it's the biggest publicly known settlement for a defamation case in US history.\n\nIn the moments after I watched the judge announce the settlement in court, 16 things went through my mind:\n\n1. Fox gets to keep its audience.\n\nDominion's CEO, lawyers, and corporate owners blasted Fox News in a press conference outside Delaware Superior Court following news of the settlement.\n\nOn Fox's end, it's hard to imagine a more tepid statement.\n\n\"We acknowledge the Court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,\" the company said in an email as its lawyers dodged journalists. \"This settlement reflects FOX's continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.\"\n\nPay attention to the first bit. The company acknowledged Judge Eric M. Davis' ruling, made last month, that it broadcasted false claims from Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani.\n\nNot \"we lied,\" or \"sorry,\" or \"we'll do better next time.\"\n\nA person familiar with the settlement terms told Insider that Fox News' hosts — including Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Jeanine Pirro, and Maria Bartiromo — would not be required to issue retractions or make any statements about Dominion whatsoever. Davis ruled that all of those hosts broadcast falsehoods about Dominion.\n\nIn other words: Fox doesn't admit to anything, except that the judge is right. Aside from forking over money, they get to do things on their own terms. The network's hosts don't have to tell their audience what they don't want to hear.\n\nThat audience may not want to hear, for instance, that Trump really lost the 2020 election. Recent polls show a majority of Republicans don't believe Biden legitimately won the presidency. As Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch himself said in a deposition for the Dominion case, Trump's fans and Fox News' audience have a lot of overlap, and he didn't want to antagonize the then-president in the election's aftermath.\n\n\"He had a very large following, and they were probably mostly viewers of Fox, so it would have been stupid,\" Murdoch said.\n\n2. $787.5 million was the price to keep it.\n\nDominion asked for $1.6 billion in damages and got about half of that, not counting legal fees. It's still a massive settlement.\n\nYou can also say that number was the price Fox paid to keep itself at the top of the right-wing media universe.\n\nFox clearly wanted to make a tepid statement about the case and avoid issuing retractions or denunciations of its own employees. Did that requirement drive up the price Dominion wanted it to pay?\n\nOne of the main arguments in Dominion's lawsuit, filed back in March 2021, was that Fox was driven to push lies about the 2020 election because it was threatened by the rise of Newsmax and One America News, two further-right media organizations that Dominion says more explicitly embraced election conspiracy theories.\n\nEvidence obtained by Dominion in the lawsuit and filed to court ahead of the settlement appeared to support that theory. Hannity and Carlson privately fretted that Newsmax's ratings could threaten Fox's dominance.\n\n\"Serious $$ with serious distribution could be a real problem. Imho they need to address but wtf do I know,\" Hannity wrote in a text message obtained by Dominion, referring to Newsmax.\n\n\"Do the executives understand how much credibility and trust we've lost with our audience? We're playing with fire, for real....an alternative like newsmax could be devastating to us,\" Carlson told his producer in another message included in filings.\n\nNewsmax and OAN are already in dire straits after DirecTV dropped them from its programming listings. Dominion and Smartmatic — a rival election technology company caught up in false 2020 election conspiracy theories — have separate pending defamation lawsuits against them as well.\n\n3. Fox avoided a likely reckoning in court.\n\nIt's extremely hard to win a defamation case against a media company in the US, given the country's strong First Amendment protections.\n\nUnfortunately for Fox, First Amendment experts widely agreed Dominion had an extremely strong case. James Goodale, a leading media lawyer and former top attorney for the New York Times, told Insider that Fox put itself in a terrible position by repeatedly hosting Powell and Giuliani on its shows. Most libel cases, he said, are over only a single disputed issue.\n\n\"In an ordinary libel case, that probably would happen once, and you fight over that one instance,\" Goodale told Insider. \"In here — I don't know, what's the number, a hundred? — it happens over and over and over again.\"\n\n4. Rupert Murdoch and other Fox brass won't have to testify.\n\nA settlement means that 92-year-old Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch gets to stay home and avoid the glare of the courtroom. His son, Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch, can kick back on his $150 million yacht instead of making the trek to Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nIt also means that executives like Fox News President Jay Wallace and CEO Suzanne Scott, and hosts like Hannity, Carlson, and the litany of others Dominion said they intended to call as witnesses, avoid the drama of a trial as well.\n\nWhile Fox News' detractors might love to see them grilled on the witness stand, Dominion got to use the prospect of testifying under oath as leverage to extract the largest settlement possible.\n\n5. Dominion won't have to deal with appeals.\n\nEven if Dominion won at trial, it would still face the prospect of years of appeals. Both Fox and Dominion hired prominent appellate attorneys for the case. In court Tuesday, each side had about two dozen lawyers filling the rows. And Fox Corp.'s top lawyer, Viet Dinh, reportedly believed Fox had good odds of winning their case if it appealed to the Supreme Court. First Amendment experts Insider spoke to strongly disagreed with Dinh on that point.\n\nNow, Dominion doesn't have to deal with any of that. So that's nice for them.\n\n6. Fox, though, has to deal with shareholder lawsuits.\n\nA historically large settlement like this might mean Fox Corp., the parent company of Fox News, will have the headache of shareholders who will claim it overpaid.\n\nOne shareholder filed a suit earlier this year in Delaware Chancery Court alleging the company breached its fiduciary duties by allowing the network to broadcast election lies in the first place, exposing it to litigation from Smartmatic and Dominion.\n\n7. Fox can afford it.\n\nFox Corp. has nearly $4.1 billion of cash on hand, Lachlan Murdoch said in February. The company, which also includes Fox Sports and the streaming service Tubi, is valued at more than $17.6 billion.\n\nIt's not clear if any of the $787.5 million settlement figure will be borne by libel insurance. Representatives and attorneys for Fox Corporation declined to answer Insider's questions about insurance arrangements.\n\n8. Still — wow!\n\nDid I mention that $787.5 million is the biggest known defamation settlement in US history? Feels like that needs its own item on this list.\n\nThe runner-up is the $177 million Disney paid to settle the infamous \"pink slime\" lawsuit against its subsidiary ABC News in 2017.\n\nThe lawyer who represented the plaintiff suing ABC News in that case is J. Erik Connolly.\n\nHe's now representing Smartmatic in its lawsuit against Fox News.\n\n9. Smartmatic is still suing.\n\nSpeaking of which, Smartmatic's separate lawsuit against Fox News is still moving forward.\n\n\"Dominion's litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox's disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest,\" Connolly said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy.\"\n\nSmartmatic's lawsuit, in New York state court, may be an even greater risk for Fox.\n\nIt's asking for $2.7 billion in damages. The suit also counts Giuliani as a defendant; it has a separate lawsuit against Powell for jurisdictional reasons.\n\nAnd as outlandish as Giuliani's and Powell's claims about Dominion were, Smartmatic's were even more fantastical. The company's technology was used in elections for only two counties in the US 2020 election. Dominion's was used in multiple states. Smartmatic has also been able to bolster its own case by drawing on evidence filed in Dominion's lawsuit.\n\nFor the same reasons Fox settled Dominion's suit, it likely wants to settle Smartmatic's suit as well — and before Smartmatic makes public more embarrassing revelations from its discovery process.\n\n10. The settlement is a victory for Delaware courts.\n\nThe settlement helps bolster the Delaware court system's reputation as a place to resolve business disputes with minimal fuss, as The Chancery Daily noted.\n\nTuesday's events, in some ways, echo last fall, where Elon Musk reached a settlement with Twitter where he agreed to purchase the company for $44 million shortly before a case was supposed to go to trial. Twitter had sued him for trying to back out of a deal where he agreed to buy the company for that sum. (Things haven't been going too well for Musk since.)\n\nSmartmatic's lawsuit against Fox, it should be noted, is in New York, where a judge has had little patience with Fox's legal positions.\n\n11. I wouldn't want to be Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani, or Mike Lindell right now.\n\nFor a lot of reasons. Legally speaking, the three are most directly responsible for the proliferation of false conspiracy theories about Dominion and Smartmatic that, according to a legal process, have caused at least $787.5 million in damages.\n\nFox News broadcast them and at times endorsed the claims, Dominion argued. But no one has hammered away at the falsehoods as prolifically and loudly as those three.\n\nMike Lindell is pretty wealthy, but I'd wager he doesn't have that much money.\n\n12. Fox dropped a big hint it would settle the suit earlier this month.\n\nOn April 8, Fox arrived at a \"confidential agreement\" to settle a separate defamation lawsuit from Venezuelan businessman Majed Khalil, according to a court filing.\n\nAfter Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, then-Fox Business News host Lou Dobbs said on Twitter that Khalil helped rig votes, an alleged plot the Trump ally amounted to a \"cyber Pearl harbor\" and \"electoral 9-11.\"\n\nKhalil sued for $250 million.\n\nFox and an attorney for Khalil declined to comment on the settlement, so it's not clear how much he got in the end. But it was a clear signal the right-wing media company was willing to pay to make these cases go away.\n\n13. Abby Grossberg takes the stage.\n\nThe weeks before the settlement were beset with twists from Abby Grossberg, a former producer for Carlson and Bartiromo. She filed lawsuits alleging Fox discriminated against her because of her gender, and that Fox lawyers coached her into giving false deposition testimony for Dominion's lawsuit. Fox fired her and denied wrongdoing.\n\nHer litigation upped the stakes for the case, bringing forth additional evidence suggesting Fox News knew that Giuliani's and Powell's claims about Dominion were false.\n\nHer attorneys on Tuesday pledged to keep her fight going and lambasted \"the network's abhorrent culture of lawlessness.\" The lawsuits are yet another headache Fox has to deal with.\n\n14. Fox News dodged another legal bullet.\n\nBecause of how Fox handled evidence related to Grossberg — as well as other evidence about Murdoch's role in Fox News — the judge appointed a special master on Tuesday morning to investigate whether Fox properly complied with the discovery process.\n\nThe investigation could have been even more embarrassing for Fox. Davis ruled that the special master could subpoena whoever he wanted and that Fox would have to pay all associated costs.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, the situation was moot. The settlement meant that the special master's investigation was called off, as NBC News reported.\n\n15. Too bad for the media reporters.\n\nFor the media reporters covering this trial, this was the story of the century. Even without a full-blown trial, the case was still an incredible story. So much of Fox News' inner workings have been exposed already. This trial was a great opportunity for more juicy material.\n\nStill, I feel a little bad for Brian Stelter, the former CNN host who announced he was working on a book about Fox News partially based on the trial, and who got a part time Vanity Fair gig covering the case. What's he going to do now? Stelter didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nRupert Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff got a Sky TV commentator job to cover the case and was reportedly in talks to write a book about it. Outside court after news of the settlement, he lamented about his \"lost weekend in Wilmington.\"\n\nOh well. There's always the Smartmatic case.\n\n16. This was great for Dominion's private equity owner.\n\nA majority of Dominion is owned by Staple Street Capital, a private equity firm.\n\nIn court filings ahead of the settlement, Fox complained about the $1.6 billion price tag Dominion put on the lawsuit. Internal valuations, it argued, showed it was worth closer to $100 million. Staple Street, Fox said, was just looking for a payday.\n\n\"Would be pretty unreal if you guys like 20x'ed your Dominion investment with these lawsuits,\" read one text to a Staple Street executive cited in a Fox court filing.\n\nWell, Staple Street got a return on its investment, alright. And Dominion's lawyers got their fees, too. Moments before the judge announced the settlement Tuesday, one top Dominion attorney in court looked like she could hardly suppress a smile.",

The network acknowledged \"the Court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,\" but will not have to apologize or issue retractions on air for the false statements that were broadcasted, a source aware of the settlement terms told Insider.\n\nThe settlement avoids what was sure to be a closely watched trial featuring some of cable TV's biggest stars and executives. Here's a breakdown of all the winners and losers.\n\nThe winners\n\nDominion Voting Systems: Fox News is paying Dominion $787.5 million — which amounts to nearly 10 times what the company is worth, according to an evaluation from 2018. The elections technology firm also gets to avoid a weekslong trial that, even if it prevailed, could have led to years of appeals.\n\nTucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and other Fox News hosts: Court documents from the case revealed texts Fox News hosts had sent each other criticizing former President Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 election, but the settlement means they now get to avoid answering questions under oath about those texts on the stand.\n\nSmartmatic: Smartmatic, the only other election technology company caught up in conspiracy theories suing Fox News, said Tuesday it is still committed to its case against the network. The large payment Dominion received could signal good news for Smartmatic, which was initially seeking $2.7 billion in damages.\n\nFox News: Fox News gets to avoid a potentially embarrassing trial and the possibility of being found to have acted with actual malice, which would mean the company knowingly and intentionally ignored the truth when it broadcasted the false statements. Fox was also not required in the settlement to issue any apologies or retractions on air, even though the judge ruled and the company acknowledged they had broadcast false statements about Dominion.\n\nThe losers\n\nFox News: Fox News had to pay the largest public settlements ever in a defamation case to avoid the prospect of a potentially embarrassing trial. The company also acknowledged that its shows had broadcast false information.\n\nDemocracy: Some observers of the case thought a public trial was necessary in order to have Fox News sufficiently answer for platforming fake news about the 2020 election. Others saw it as a way to make the \"big lie\" — the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen — finally go away. Now there's no chance of that happening, at least not as a result of this trial.\n\nUs: The public misses out on the chance to see some of the most-watched cable news hosts get grilled on the stand over their coverage of the 2020 election.\n\nRudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell: The former Trump lawyers who made the false statements that were broadcast on Fox News were in no way vindicated by the settlement. The judge in the trial had already ruled Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell had made false statements, and each is still facing lawsuits of their own.",

Lies have consequences. … todays settlement of $787 million represent … accountability.” — Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) April 18, 2023\n\nFox News had pushed to settle over the weekend, perhaps an indication of how it felt about its chances in court. The trial was even delayed by one day, apparently to give the sides time to hammer out an agreement. With no such bargain struck, a jury was selected on Tuesday, and opening arguments were scheduled for the afternoon. But before they got under way, there was an unexplained 90-minute-plus delay. CNN reported that a top Fox lawyer in the courtroom flashed a piece of paper to a Dominion lawyer. The two briefly stepped out before returning and speaking across their tables. Dominion’s lawyers had generally seemed pleased throughout the day, another sign of the direction things were headed.\n\nDominion’s side has been all smiles last few hours.

Defamation cases are notoriously difficult to prove in U.S. courts, but Dominion was thought to have an unusually strong chance of victory. That was thanks in large part to voluminous texts and emails showing that everyone from Murdoch to star hosts such as Tucker Carlson knew the election wasn’t rigged yet continued to air outlandish claims from Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and others following Election Day.",

                    "snippet": "Fox and Dominion Voting Systems reached a $787 million settlement Tuesday in the voting machine company’s defamation lawsuit, averting a trial in a case that exposed how the top-rated network chased viewers by promoting lies about the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said in a news conference outside the courthouse after a judge announced the deal.\n\nDominion had asked for $1.6 billion in arguing that Fox had damaged its reputation by helping peddle phony conspiracy theories about its equipment switching votes from former President Donald Trump to Democrat Joe Biden. Fox said the amount greatly overstated the value of the Colorado-based company.\n\nThe resolution in Delaware Superior Court follows a recent ruling by Judge Eric Davis in which he allowed the case to go to trial while emphasizing it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations about Dominion aired on Fox by Trump allies were true.\n\nIn a statement issued shortly after the announcement, Fox News said the network acknowledged “the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.” It did not respond to an inquiry asking for elaboration.\n\nInquiries to Dominion and Fox Corp. were not immediately returned.\n\nRecords released as part of the lawsuit showed how Fox hosts and executives did not believe the claims by Trump’s allies but aired them anyway, in part to win back viewers who were fleeing the network after it correctly called hotly contested Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden on election night.\n\nThe settlement, if formally accepted by the judge, will end a case that has proven a major embarrassment for Fox News. If the case had gone to trial, it also would have presented one of the sternest tests to a libel standard that has protected media organizations for more than half a century.\n\nSeveral First Amendment experts had said Dominion’s case was among the strongest they had ever seen. Still, there was real doubt about whether Dominion would be able to prove to a jury that people in a decision-making capacity at Fox could be held responsible for the network’s airing of the falsehoods.\n\nDominion accused Fox of defaming it by repeatedly airing, in the weeks after the 2020 presidential election, false allegations by Trump allies that its machines and the software they used had flipped votes to Biden — even as many at the network doubted the claims and disparaged those who were making them.\n\nThe company sued both Fox News and its parent, Fox Corp., and said its business had been significantly damaged.\n\nDuring a deposition, Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who founded the network, testified that he believed the 2020 election was fair and had not been stolen from Trump.\n\n“Fox knew the truth,” Dominion argued in court papers. “It knew the allegations against Dominion were ‘outlandish’ and ‘crazy’ and ‘ludicrous’ and ‘nuts.’ Yet it used the power and influence of its platform to promote that false story.”\n\nIn his March 31 summary judgment ruling, Davis pointedly called out the news organization for airing falsehoods while noting how the bogus election claims persist, 2 1/2 years after Trump lost his bid for reelection.\n\n“The statements at issue were dramatically different than the truth,” Davis said in that ruling. “In fact, although it cannot be attributed directly to Fox’s statements, it is noteworthy that some Americans still believe the election was rigged.”\n\n“We never reported those to be true,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said. “All we ever did was provide viewers the true fact that these were allegations that were being made.”\n\nFox said Dominion had argued that the network was obligated to suppress the allegations or denounce them as false.\n\n“Freedom of speech and of the press would be illusory if the prevailing side in a public controversy could sue the press for giving a forum to the losing side,” Fox said in court papers.\n\nIn a 1964 case involving The New York Times, the U.S. Supreme Court limited the ability of public figures to sue for defamation. The court ruled that plaintiffs needed to prove that news outlets published or aired false material with “actual malice” — knowing such material was false or acting with a “reckless disregard” for whether or not it was true.\n\nThat has provided news organizations with stout protection against libel judgments. Yet the nearly six-decade legal standard has come under attack by some conservatives in recent years, including Trump and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who have argued for making it easier to win a libel case.\n\nTwo Republican-nominated Supreme Court justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have publicly expressed interest in revisiting the protection.\n\nDominion’s lawyers argued that Fox made a deliberate decision to repeatedly air the false claims to appeal to viewers. They allowed guests to falsely claim that the company had rigged the election, flipped large numbers of votes to Biden through a secret algorithm, was owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chavez, the late president, and bribed government officials.\n\n“What they did to get viewers back was start this new narrative that the election had been stolen and that Dominion was the thief,” Dominion lawyer Rodney Smolla said during a March hearing.\n\nA mountain of evidence — released in the form of deposition transcripts, internal memos and emails from the time — was damaging to Fox even if some of it was only tangentially related to the libel argument.\n\nDominion has pointed to text and email messages in which Fox insiders discounted and sometimes overtly mocked the vote manipulation claims. One Fox Corp. vice president called them “MIND BLOWINGLY NUTS.”\n\nMuch of the material showed a network effectively terrified of its audience after its election night declaration that Biden had won Arizona. The race call infuriated Trump and many viewers who supported him.\n\nOne of Fox’s top news anchors, Bret Baier, noted the audience’s anger and suggested rescinding the call, even awarding the state to Trump.\n\n“We don’t want to antagonize Trump further,” Murdoch said in a Nov. 16 memo.\n\nBiden narrowly won Arizona, but two executives responsible for the accurate election night call lost their jobs because of it two months later. In an internal memo, Murdoch talked in mid-November about firing them.\n\nFox executives and anchors discussed how not to alienate the audience, many of whom believed Trump’s claims of fraud despite no evidence to back them up. Fox’s Tucker Carlson suggested a news reporter be fired for tweeting a fact check debunking the fraud claims.\n\nSome of the exhibits were simply embarrassing, such as scornful behind-the-scenes opinions about Trump, whose supporters form the core of the network’s viewers. Text exchanges revealed as part of the lawsuit show Carlson declaring, “I hate him passionately,” and saying that “we are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.”",

                    "snippet": "WILMINGTON, Del. — Fox News agreed Tuesday to pay Dominion Voting Systems nearly $800 million to avert a trial in the voting machine company’s lawsuit that would have exposed how the network promoted lies about the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe stunning settlement emerged just as opening statements were supposed to begin, abruptly ending a case that had embarrassed Fox News over several months and raised the possibility that network founder Rupert Murdoch and stars such as Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity would have to testify publicly.\n\n“The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson told reporters outside a Delaware courthouse after Superior Court Judge Eric Davis announced the deal.\n\nOutside of the $787.5 million promised to Colorado-based Dominion, it was unclear what other consequences Fox would face. Fox acknowledged in a statement “the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” but no apology was offered.\n\n“We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” Fox said. Its lawyers and representatives offered no other comment or details about the settlement.\n\nAsked by a reporter whether there was “anything to this other than money,” Dominion CEO John Poulos did not answer.\n\nThe deal is a significant amount of money even for a company the size of Fox. It represents about one-quarter of the $2.96 billion the company reported earning last year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — a figure often used to approximate a company’s cash flow.\n\nThe settlement also follows a $965 million judgment issued last year against Alex Jones by a Connecticut jury for spreading false conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook school massacre.\n\nDon’t miss: 2020 election ‘was not stolen,’ Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch said under oath, according to evidence in Dominion case\n\nCoupled with other lawsuits in the pipeline, the agreement shows there is a real financial risk for conservative media that traffic in conspiracy theories. What remains unknown is how much of a deterrent this will be. Even as the Dominion case loomed this spring, Fox’s Tucker Carlson aired his alternate theories about what happened at the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nDominion had sued Fox for $1.6 billion, arguing that the top-rated news outlet damaged the company’s reputation by peddling phony conspiracy theories that claimed its equipment switched votes from former President Donald Trump to Democrat Joe Biden. Davis, in an earlier ruling, said it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations about Dominion aired on Fox by Trump allies were true.\n\nDominion set out to prove in the lawsuit that Fox acted with malice in airing allegations that it knew to be false, or with “reckless disregard” for the truth. It presented volumes of internal emails and text messages that showed Fox executives and personalities saying they knew the accusations were untrue, even as the falsehoods were aired on programs hosted by Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs and Jeannine Pirro.\n\nRecords released as part of the lawsuit showed that Fox aired the claims in part to win back viewers who were fleeing the network after it correctly called hotly contested Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden on election night. One Fox Corp. vice president called them “MIND BLOWINGLY NUTS.”\n\nDuring a deposition, Murdoch testified that he believed the 2020 election was fair and had not been stolen from Trump.\n\n“Fox knew the truth,” Dominion argued in court papers. “It knew the allegations against Dominion were ‘outlandish’ and ‘crazy’ and ‘ludicrous’ and ‘nuts.’ Yet it used the power and influence of its platform to promote that false story.”\n\nSeveral First Amendment experts said Dominion’s case was among the strongest they had ever seen. But there was real doubt about whether Dominion would be able to prove to a jury that people in a decision-making capacity at Fox could be held responsible for the network’s actions.\n\nDominion’s Nelson called the settlement “a tremendous victory” and noted that there are six more lawsuits pending regarding election claims.\n\n“We settled because it was about accountability,” Nelson said in an interview. “Our goals were to make sure that there was accountability for the lies, and to try to make our client right. And we accomplished both goals.”\n\nIt’s hard to tell what the deal will mean financially for Dominion. The company would not provide its most recent earnings, saying the figures were not public.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the trial, Davis significantly narrowed Fox’s potential line of defense, including nixing the network’s argument that it was merely airing newsworthy allegations. Newsworthiness is not a defense against defamation, he said.\n\nIn a March 31 ruling, he pointedly called out the network for airing falsehoods while noting that bogus election claims still persist more than two years after Trump lost his bid for reelection.\n\n“The statements at issue were dramatically different than the truth,” Davis said in that ruling. “In fact, although it cannot be attributed directly to Fox’s statements, it is noteworthy that some Americans still believe the election was rigged.”\n\nIn its defense, Fox said it was obligated to report on a president who claimed that he had been cheated out of reelection.\n\n“We never reported those to be true,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said. “All we ever did was provide viewers the true fact that these were allegations that were being made.”\n\nDominion had sued both Fox News and its parent, Fox Corp, and said its business had been significantly damaged. Fox said the company grossly overestimated its losses, before agreeing to pay about half of what Dominion had asked for.\n\nIn a 1964 case involving The New York Times, the U.S. Supreme Court limited the ability of public figures to sue for defamation. The court ruled that plaintiffs needed to prove that news outlets published or aired false material with “actual malice” — knowing such material was false or acting with a “reckless disregard” for whether or not it was true.\n\nThat has provided news organizations with stout protection against libel judgments. Yet the nearly six-decade legal standard has come under attack by some conservatives in recent years, including Trump and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who have argued for making it easier to win a libel case.\n\n“The larger importance of the settlement … is that the high level of protection for news media in a defamation case remains intact for now,” said Doreen Weisenhaus, an instructor of media law at Northwestern University.\n\nIn documents released in recent months, Fox executives and anchors discussed how not to alienate the audience, many of whom believed Trump’s claims of fraud despite no evidence to back them up. Fox’s Tucker Carlson suggested a news reporter be fired for tweeting a fact check debunking the fraud claims.\n\nSome of the exhibits were simply embarrassing, such as scornful behind-the-scenes opinions about Trump, whose supporters form the core of the network’s viewers. Text exchanges revealed as part of the lawsuit show Carlson declaring, “I hate him passionately,” and saying that “we are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.”\n\nFox News announced the settlement on Neil Cavuto’s afternoon news show. “It’s a done deal,” he said. “It’s a settlement and for at least Fox, it appears to be over.”\n\nBut Fox’s legal problems may not be over. It still faces a defamation lawsuit from another voting technology company, Smartmatic. Its lawyer, Erik Connolly, said Tuesday that “Dominion’s litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox’s disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest.”\n\nFox News parent Fox Corp.

                    "snippet": "WILMINGTON, Del. — Fox and Dominion Voting Systems reached a settlement Tuesday in the voting machine company’s defamation lawsuit, averting a trial in a case that exposed how the top-rated network chased viewers by promoting lies about the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe terms of the settlement were not immediately clear.\n\nDominion had asked for $1.6 billion in arguing that Fox had damaged its reputation by helping peddle conspiracy theories about its equipment. Fox said the amount greatly overstated the value of the Colorado-based company.\n\nThe settlement was announced by the judge in the case, who allowed the case to go to trial while emphasizing that it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations about Dominion aired on Fox by allies of former President Donald Trump were true.\n\nRecords released as part of the lawsuit showed how Fox hosts and executives did not believe the claims by Trump’s allies but aired them anyway, in part to win back viewers who were fleeing the network after it correctly called hotly contested Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden on election night.\n\nIf accepted by the judge, the settlement will end a case that has proved a major embarrassment for Fox News. If it had gone to trial, it also would have presented one of the sternest tests to a libel standard that has protected media organizations for over half a century.\n\nSeveral First Amendment experts had said Dominion’s case was among the strongest they had ever seen. But there was real doubt about whether Dominion would be able to prove to a jury that people in a decision-making capacity at Fox could be held responsible for the network airing the falsehoods.\n\nUltimately, there appeared to be too much at risk for both sides to allow them to put the case in the hands of a jury.\n\nDominion accused Fox of libel for repeatedly airing, in the weeks after the 2020 presidential election, false allegations by Trump allies that its machines and the software they used had switched votes to Biden — even though many at the network doubted the claims and disparaged those making them.\n\nThe company sued both Fox News and its parent, Fox Corp.\n\nDuring a deposition, Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who founded the news network, testified that he believed the 2020 election was fair and had not been stolen from the former president.\n\n“Fox knew the truth,” Dominion argued in court papers. “It knew the allegations against Dominion were ‘outlandish’ and ‘crazy’ and ‘ludicrous’ and ‘nuts.’ Yet it used the power and influence of its platform to promote that false story.”\n\nIn a March 31 ruling, Davis pointedly called out the news organization for airing falsehoods while noting how the bogus election claims persist, 2 1/2 years after Trump lost his bid for reelection.\n\n“The statements at issue were dramatically different than the truth,” Davis said in his summary judgment ruling. “In fact, although it cannot be attributed directly to Fox’s statements, it is noteworthy that some Americans still believe the election was rigged.”\n\nIn its defense, Fox said it was obligated to report on the most newsworthy of stories — a president claiming that he had been cheated out of reelection.\n\n“We never reported those to be true,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said. “All we ever did was provide viewers the true fact that these were allegations that were being made.”\n\nFox said Dominion had argued that the network was obligated to suppress the allegations or denounce them as false.\n\n“Freedom of speech and of the press would be illusory if the prevailing side in a public controversy could sue the press for giving a forum to the losing side,” Fox said in court papers.\n\nIn a 1964 case involving The New York Times, the U.S. Supreme Court limited the ability of public figures to sue for defamation. It ruled that plaintiffs needed to prove that news outlets published or aired false material with “actual malice” — knowing it was false or acting with a “reckless disregard” for whether or not it was true.\n\nThat has provided news organizations with stout protection against libel judgments. Yet the nearly six-decade legal standard has come under attack by some conservatives in recent years, including Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who have argued for making it easier to win a libel case.\n\nTwo Republican-nominated Supreme Court justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have publicly expressed interest in revisiting the protection.\n\nDominion’s attorneys argued that Fox made a deliberate decision to repeatedly air the false claims to appeal to viewers. They allowed guests to falsely claim that the company had rigged the election, flipped large numbers of votes to Biden through a secret algorithm, was owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chavez, and bribed government officials.\n\n“What they did to get viewers back was start this new narrative that the election had been stolen and that Dominion was the thief,” Dominion attorney Rodney Smolla said during a March hearing.\n\nA mountain of evidence — released in the form of deposition transcripts, internal memos and emails from the time — was damaging to Fox even if some of the material was only tangentially related to the libel argument.\n\nMuch of the material showed a network effectively terrified of its audience after its election night declaration that Biden had won Arizona. The race call infuriated Trump and many viewers who supported him.\n\nOne of Fox’s top news anchors, Bret Baier, noted the audience’s anger and suggested rescinding the call, even awarding the state to Trump.\n\n“We don’t want to antagonize Trump further,” Murdoch said in a Nov. 16 memo.\n\nBiden narrowly won Arizona, but two executives responsible for the accurate election night call lost their jobs because of it two months later. In an internal memo, Murdoch talked in mid-November about firing them.\n\nFox executives and anchors discussed how not to alienate the audience, many of whom believed Trump’s claims of fraud despite no evidence to back them up. Fox’s Tucker Carlson suggested a news reporter be fired for tweeting a fact check debunking the fraud claims.\n\nSome of the exhibits were simply embarrassing, such as scornful behind-the-scenes opinions about Trump, including a Carlson text message that said, “I hate him passionately.”\n\n___\n\nChase reported from Dover, Delaware.",

Judge Eric Davis this morning appointed Delaware litigator John A. Elzufon to probe whether Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corp., had \"complied with their discovery obligations.\" The settlement reached between both parties this afternoon averted a trial but initially left unclear whether Elzufon's work would continue. The source familiar with the matter said tonight that Elzufon's investigation will not go forward. Dominion declined to comment, and Fox did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Davis last week sanctioned Fox for not turning over evidence in a timely fashion. The evidence in question included audio recordings of Rudy Giuliani appearing to concede to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo that he did not have proof of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Elzufon had been given a wide investigative berth. In a four-page filing this morning, Davis said Elzufon could request depositions with whomever he wishes and that the associated costs must be paid by Fox.

The confidential aspect of most settlements means it's not possible to know whether there's been a larger one. Another sizable defamation penalty came just last year in the Connecticut lawsuit brought against Infowars' Alex Jones and his company, Free Speech Systems. Last year, Jones was ordered to pay $1.4 billion for defamation stemming from the suit. In that case, a judge ordered Jones to pay $473 million in punitive damages to families of the victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting after he promoted false claims that the massacre was a hoax. The penalty was in addition to an earlier demand from jurors that Jones pay $965 million to the victims' families and an FBI agent who responded to the 2012 attack.

What a disaster,\" O'Reilly wrote on his website. O’Reilly, who was ousted from the network in April 2017 after an internal investigation into allegations of sexual harassment, went on to criticize Fox. “This is what happens when money becomes more important than honest information,” he wrote. “Once the facts begin to overwhelm any point of view, a news agency has an obligation to say that,” O'Reilly said, adding that he lost more than a thousand paid members after he concluded the 2020 election was not stolen. “Fox News saw it differently, and now payment has been rendered,” he said. “But the nightmare will continue for FNC.” Share this -\n\n\n\n\n\nLink copied\n\nDominion suggests no on-air apology coming from Fox Pressed about whether the settlement would require Fox News to issue an on-air retraction, correction or apology, a Dominion spokesperson did not directly answer but indicated that Fox’s acknowledgment of having made false statements is likely to be the only apology the public would see. “An apology is about accountability, and today Dominion held Fox accountable,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Fox paid a historic settlement and issued a statement acknowledging that the statements about Dominion were false.” In a statement after the settlement was announced in court, Fox News said, “We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.” Share this -\n\n\n\n\n\nLink copied\n\nDominion lawyer on Fox settlement: 'The truth matters' Dominion lawyer Stephen Shackelford said he hoped the settlement will have a lasting impact on the news industry.

Timm offers this view from the room while on lunch break. The Delaware Superior Court’s largest courtroom is packed to the gills for the first day of trial, with lawyers, reporters, publicists and members of the public filling the long rows of wooden benches. While the top lawyers sit at cushy chairs in front of large desks inside the well of the court, more than a dozen of their law firm colleagues are in the first rows behind the bar. Those colleagues — a mix of lawyers and support staff — are packed so tightly that some have arms around their colleagues. Rows of reporters sit behind them clacking away on keyboards, earning a request from Davis that reporters attempt to type more quietly so as not to make the jurors think one moment is more noteworthy than others. In this room, the typing itself can cause quite a din and the judge said he worried it would influence the jury.

Dominion is at the center of one of the biggest media trials in decades. But you have probably heard considerably less about Staple Street Capital, the New York private equity firm that owns it. Staple Street Capital paid $38.3 million for a roughly 75% majority stake in Dominion in July 2018. The firm valued the technology vendor at roughly $80 million at the time, Fox has said in legal filings. Stephen D. Owens and Hootan Yaghoobzadeh, the co-founders of Staple Street, both used to work at the Carlyle Group, one of the most powerful private equity firms in the world. Street Street says it has roughly $900 million in assets under management, with a portfolio that includes an IT services provider, a payroll reporting service, a natural gas compression company and a New Jersey-based flower bulb distributor.

The ruling spares Dominion from having to litigate baseless conspiracy theories about its role in the 2020 election. “The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,” the judge wrote in his 81-page ruling, emphasizing the word “crystal” in bold. Fox News had argued that the challenged comments were opinion and protected as such, but Davis disagreed. “The Court finds, as a matter of law, that the Statements are either fact or mixed opinion,” he wrote. “The Statements were capable of being proven true, and in fact the evidence that would prove the Statements was discussed many times (but never presented).” Share this -\n\n\n\n\n\nLink copied\n\nIn private, Fox News stars and staffers blasted election fraud claims as bogus, court filings show Court filings unsealed leading up to the case going to trial gave the public an unprecedented look behind the scenes at Fox News after the 2020 election. The filings, along with the underlying exhibits, showed that executives, stars and producers of the network knew the claims about Dominion were without merit. The trove of internal communications also suggested that Fox News zeroed in on fraud claims to boost ratings and appease its core viewers, who executives feared were abandoning the channel for other conservative media outlets — particularly after Fox News was the first network to project that Biden had won the key battleground state of Arizona on his way to winning the White House in 2020.

Fox News trial As then-President Trump and his allies relentlessly pushed the lie that the 2020 election he legitimately lost to Biden was stolen from him, baseless conspiracy theories about the voting machines made by Dominion proliferated. In 2021, Dominion filed a defamation suit against Fox News and its parent company, challenging a number of statements made on air by hosts and guests and seeking $1.6 billion in damages for harm it said was caused by lies about its machines. The judge has already agreed with Dominion that the statements were wrong. However, Fox News has argued that the network was reporting on Trump's extraordinary claims of election fraud. In defending against the claims, Fox says that it is fighting to protect press freedoms and that the U.S. Constitution shields its work. Read more about the case, and what's at stake, here.

                    "snippet": "The voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems has reportedly reached a $787 million settlement with Fox in its defamation suit against the network over misleading coverage of the 2020 election, just before the case was slated to go to trial.\n\nDominion Voting Systems has claimed that Fox News knowingly boosted lies about the voting machine company rigging the election against former President Donald Trump that caused irreparable harm to its business. In a news conference Tuesday, Dominion attorney Justin Nelson said that the settlement represented “accountability.”\n\n“This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” Fox said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThough the case has ended on day one of the planned five-week trial, voluminous court filings have already revealed text messages and emails among Fox producers, on-air personalities, and executives — including chair Rupert Murdoch — providing a rare window into how the network elevated false conspiracy theories, even as top Fox officials privately dismissed them. Those communications also show how Murdoch played a key role in shaping coverage and endorsed the network’s strategy of catering to its viewers who still believed in Trump.\n\nFox had tried to tie its fate in the case to the future of media, arguing that a judgment forcing the company to pay up for reporting on allegations made by the then-president would have eroded press freedoms under the First Amendment more broadly. But legal experts have said that if Fox couldn’t be held accountable for its wrongful journalistic practices in this case, no news organization can be.\n\n“The conduct here is way over the line,” said Angelo Carusone, president of the watchdog organization Media Matters for America, ahead of the settlement. “It’s extraordinary for a person in [Murdoch’s] position to be so actively steering news coverage around anything, let alone a specific story that they know is not true. I think that’s partly why it’s hard to apply what’s happening in this case to other news operations.”\n\nWhile Fox may have been able to avoid a decision on those thornier First Amendment questions at play in the case by settling, it’s still on the hook not just financially but potentially reputationally. That still might not stop the most-watched network in cable news from continuing its editorial strategy of obscuring truths that could alienate its mostly right-wing audience.\n\n“I think Fox’s coverage in the short term gets brighter and hotter as a last-ditch play to retain their audience,” Carusone said.\n\nFox’s financial and legal troubles don’t end there: Smartmatic, another voting technology company, is also demanding damages of $2.7 billion in a separate defamation suit against Fox, which is soon scheduled to move forward.\n\nFurthermore, a Fox shareholder sued Murdoch last week for breach of fiduciary duty over his failure to prevent the network from advancing Trump’s election lies and exposing itself to legal liability. Some companies with business ties to Fox are reportedly contemplating similar litigation.\n\nDon’t expect Fox to change its ways\n\nThe lawsuit was costly for Fox in ways that go beyond the settlement money itself.\n\nAs part of the discovery process, Dominion obtained extensive internal documentation from Fox, which it revealed in pretrial court filings over the past few months. The revelations embarrassed the network, showing some Fox hosts privately didn’t believe Trump’s false claims of a stolen election yet played along anyway on air, and how executives and opinion hosts were irate at their news side colleagues for debunking Trump’s claims.\n\nYet anyone hoping this experience will spur Fox to change its ways is likely headed for disappointment.\n\nIndeed, as the lawsuit advanced, Fox seemed to draw closer to Trump again, after a period in which the coverage of the former president had been toned down. In the past month, Trump has given interviews to Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson — the latter of whom had privately texted in 2021 that he hated Trump “passionately” and that the Trump era was a “disaster” with no “upside,” a Dominion filing revealed.\n\nThe lesson the network will likely take from this fiasco is more limited: that the invented, conspiratorial nonsense about Dominion changing votes went a bit too far over the line, so they need to be somewhat more careful with making obviously false claims in the future. Perhaps some of the right’s kookiest claims will be avoided or caveated a bit more before appearing on Fox.\n\nBut the network certainly won’t give up on conspiracy theories or on pandering to the GOP base’s resentments — as Carlson’s recent segments about the January 6, 2021 attacks demonstrate. All that is core to their business model. That was one of the biggest takeaways from all those internal Fox documents — that the network is terrified of alienating its own Trump-supporting audience, and feels compelled to do whatever it takes to retain their trust and loyalty.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated frequently.",

                    "snippet": "WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -Fox Corp and Fox News have resolved a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems, the judge in the case said on Tuesday, averting a high-profile trial putting one of the world's top media companies in the crosshairs over its coverage of false vote-rigging claims in the 2020 U.S. election.\n\nThe resolution, whose terms were not immediately disclosed, was announced at the 11th hour, with a 12-person jury selected on Tuesday morning and the case poised to kick off with opening statements on Tuesday afternoon. Dominion had sought $1.6 billion in damages in the lawsuit filed in 2021, with Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis presiding over the case in Wilmington.\n\nDavis had ordered a one-day trial postponement on Monday before the delay on Tuesday, apparently as the two sides hammered out a deal.\n\nThe deal spares Fox the peril of having some of its best-known figures called to the witness stand and subjected to potentially withering questioning, from executives including Rupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old media mogul who serves as Fox Corp chairman, and Fox CEO Suzanne Scott as well as on-air hosts including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro.\n\nThe decision to settle also followed a ruling by the judge that Fox could not invoke free speech protections under the U.S. Constitution in its defense.\n\nAt issue in the lawsuit was whether Fox was liable for airing the false claims that Denver-based Dominion's ballot-counting machines were used to manipulate the 2020 U.S. election in favor of Democrat Joe Biden over Republican then-President Donald Trump. Dominion argued that these on-air claims caused the company \"enormous and irreparable economic harm.\"\n\nFox News is the most-watched U.S. cable news network, according to Nielsen.\n\nThe primary question for jurors was to be whether Fox knowingly spread false information or recklessly disregarded the truth, the standard of \"actual malice\" that Dominion must show to prevail in a defamation case. Based on a slew of internal communications, Dominion alleged that Fox staff, from newsroom employees all the way up to Murdoch, knew the statements were false but continued to air them out of fear of losing viewers to media competitors on the right.\n\nAdding to the legal risks for Fox, another U.S. voting technology company, Smartmatic, is pursuing its own defamation lawsuit seeking $2.7 billion in damages in a New York state court. Fox Corp reported nearly $14 billion in annual revenue last year.\n\nIn February court filings, Dominion cited a trove of internal communications in which Murdoch and other Fox figures privately acknowledged that the vote-rigging claims made about Dominion on-air were false. Dominion said Fox amplified the untrue claims to boost its ratings and prevent its viewers from migrating to other media competitors on the right including One America News Network, which Dominion is suing separately.\n\nFox had argued that claims by Trump and his lawyers about the election were inherently newsworthy and protected by the Constitution's First Amendment.\n\nDavis ruled in March that Fox could not use those arguments, finding its coverage was false, defamatory and not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nDominion in 2021 sued Fox Corp and Fox News, contending that its business was ruined by the false vote-rigging claims that were aired by the influential American cable news outlet known for its roster of conservative commentators.\n\nThe trial was to have been a test of whether Fox's coverage crossed the line between ethical journalism and the pursuit of ratings, as Dominion alleges and Fox denies. Fox had portrayed itself in the pretrial skirmishing as a defender of press freedom.\n\nThe complaints referenced instances in which Trump allies including his former lawyers Rudolph Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on Fox News to advance the false allegations about Dominion.\n\nDominion obtained internal communications and testimony from Murdoch and other Fox News executives and commentators. Murdoch internally described the election-rigging claims as \"really crazy\" and \"damaging\" but declined to wield his editorial power to stop them and conceded under oath that some Fox hosts nonetheless \"endorsed\" the baseless claims, Dominion told the court in a filing.\n\nWhen Murdoch watched Giuliani and Powell make their claims about Dominion on Nov. 19, he characterized them to Fox News Chief Executive Suzanne Scott as \"terrible stuff damaging everybody, I fear,” according to the filing.\n\nUnder questioning from a Dominion lawyer, Murdoch testified that he thought everything about the election was on the \"up-and-up\" and doubted the rigging claims from the very beginning, according to Dominion's filing.\n\nAsked if he could have intervened to stop Giuliani from continuing to spread falsehoods on air, Murdoch responded, \"I could have. But I didn't,\" the filing said.\n\n(Reporting by Helen Coster in Wilmington and Jack Queen in New York; writing by Tom Hals and editing by Will Dunham)",

                    "snippet": "Fox News settled a defamation case Tuesday brought by Dominion Voting Systems over allegations aired by the network that the 2020 presidential election was rigged in part by Dominion’s voting machines.\n\nDominion had sought $1.6 billion from Fox News, but just before opening statements began — and with a jury already picked — the trial came to a halt.\n\nThe lawyers had met with the judge for about 2 hours and agreed to settle the dispute. The exact amount is not known, but CNN reported the amount was for $787.5 million.\n\nFox did not disclose the amount, as is typical in settlements.\n\n“We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems,” Fox said in a statement. “We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dominion’s attorneys thanked the media for following the case, saying they’ll continue to pursue accountability from other outlets as well.\n\n“We will see you at the next one,” said Davida Brook, a lawyer for Dominion.\n\nThe discovery process uncovered that Fox officials — in private texts and emails — doubted claims that the 2020 election was rigged.\n\nDominion accused Fox of libel for repeatedly airing, in the weeks after the 2020 presidential election, false allegations by Trump allies that its machines and the software they used had switched votes to Democrat Joseph R. Biden — even though many at the network doubted the claims and disparaged those making them.\n\nRecords released as part of the lawsuit showed how Fox hosts and executives aired the claims in part to win back viewers who were fleeing the network after it correctly called hotly contested Arizona for Mr. Biden on election night.\n\nDuring a deposition, Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who founded the news network, testified that he believed the 2020 election was fair and had not been stolen from Mr. Trump.\n\n“Fox knew the truth,” Dominion argued in court papers. “It knew the allegations against Dominion were ‘outlandish’ and ‘crazy’ and ‘ludicrous’ and ‘nuts.’ Yet it used the power and influence of its platform to promote that false story.”\n\nStill, while covering the settlement announcement, Fox News host Neil Cavuto said the network did not admit to defaming the voting machine company.\n\n“Fox had denied any wrongdoing,” Mr. Cavuto said.\n\nFox had argued the statements were not defamation and were protected under the “fair report” privilege and as opinion.\n\nA mountain of evidence — released in the form of deposition transcripts, internal memos and emails from the time — was damaging to Fox even if some of the material was only tangentially related to the libel argument.\n\nMuch of the material showed a network effectively terrified of its audience after its election night declaration that Mr. Biden had won Arizona. The race call infuriated Mr. Trump and many viewers who supported him.\n\nOne of Fox’s top news anchors, Bret Baier, noted the audience’s anger and suggested rescinding the call, even awarding the state to Trump.\n\n“We don’t want to antagonize Trump further,” Mr. Murdoch said in a Nov. 16 memo.\n\nMr. Biden narrowly won Arizona, but two executives responsible for the accurate election night call lost their jobs because of it two months later. In an internal memo, Mr. Murdoch talked in mid-November about firing them.\n\nFox executives and anchors discussed how not to alienate the audience, many of whom believed Mr. Trump’s claims of fraud despite no evidence to back them up. Fox’s Tucker Carlson suggested a news reporter be fired for tweeting a fact check debunking the fraud claims.\n\nSome of the exhibits were simply embarrassing, such as scornful behind-the-scenes opinions about Mr. Trump, including a Carlson text message that said, “I hate him passionately.”\n\n• This article is based in part on wire-service reports.\n\n• Alex Swoyer can be reached at aswoyer@washingtontimes.com.",

                    "snippet": "The media defamation case of the century has settled before the opening arguments.\n\nFox Corp. has settled the high-profile defamation case brought against it by Dominion Voting Systems, effectively putting an end to the suit.\n\nJudge Eric Davis announced the resolution in court Tuesday, after the start of the trial was delayed by two hours. “The parties have resolved their case,” Davis said.\n\nTerms of the settlement were not immediately disclosed, though Dominion had been seeking $1.6 billion from Fox in its suit. In a press conference after court was adjourned, Dominion’s lawyer said the settlement was for $787 million and that it represented “accountability.” A source familiar with the terms said they did not dictate an on-air apology.\n\n“We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems,” a Fox spokesperson said Tuesday. “We acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nThe slow-burn nature of the discovery process has led to revealing correspondence from Fox News’ leading talent — Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and others — showing that the on-air anchors were skeptical of the narrative of widespread election fraud that Trump’s legal advisers were pushing at the time. Yet Fox News still allowed those opinions to air, with the rationale that, as president, Trump’s messaging was newsworthy regardless of the veracity of the claims.\n\nThat testimony hasn’t been limited to on-air talent. Emails and correspondence from Fox moguls Rupert Murdoch and son Lachlan Murdoch have been released and picked over in the media for a revealing view at how the most watched, conservative cable news brand is run. Rupert Murdoch, for example, disclosed in testimony that he makes coverage suggestions to Fox News execs and had also instructed leadership on which guests not to book, including former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, whom he had described as “a fringe character.”\n\nDuring the course of testimony, Rupert Murdoch was asked if he could’ve instructed Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott to stop airing the likes of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had been at the forefront of spreading election related fraud claims. “I could have,” Murdoch stated, “but I didn’t.”\n\nMurdoch, in testimony, also conceded that Fox hosts at times endorsed the notion of a stolen election, replying in the affirmative under questioning and naming Fox Business host Lou Dobbs and anchor Maria Bartiromo as commentators.\n\nIt was a rare public look at the typically secretive inner workings of arguably the most powerful media outlet in America.\n\nDominion is a manufacturer of voting equipment, and after President Trump lost the 2020 election, it was the subject of numerous conspiracy theories, some of which were pushed by Trump’s lawyers Giuliani and Sidney Powell. Both appeared on Fox News a number of times in the weeks after the election, and some of Fox’s hosts (notably Dobbs and Bartiromo) seemed to be sympathetic to the conspiracies.\n\nDominion sued Fox Corp. in March 2021.\n\nFox News argued that it was simply covering the news, and with President Trump and his attorneys making the claims about Dominion and the election, they were inherently newsworthy. Dominion argued that Fox executives were spooked that competitors like Newsmax were having some success in siphoning Fox’s audience away, and the outlet wanted to do whatever it took to keep their viewers happy, even if it meant parroting a conspiracy its employees knew not to be true.\n\nEarlier in April, Fox settled another defamation suit tied to the aftermath of the 2020 election, one filed by a Venezuelan businessman named Majed Khalil, who was the subject of a Dobbs segment that painted him as part of a conspiracy to steal the election for Joe Biden.\n\nFox is also being sued by electronic voting firm Smartmatic USA Corp., which filed its own lawsuit over the fraud claims in February 2021.\n\nErik Hayden contributed to this report.",

                    "snippet": "The so-called Media Trial of the Century won’t go to trial after all.\n\nJust as lawyers for both sides were about to give their opening statements, Judge Eric Davis entered the courtroom and announced the stunning news: “The parties have resolved the case.”\n\nJust like that, it was over. Over before it really even got started.\n\nBut the aftershocks will continue.\n\nDominion Voting Systems was suing Fox News for $1.6 billion, claiming the network had guests on air who put forth unproven lies that Dominion’s voting machines flipped the election from Donald Trump to Joe Biden and that Fox News knew the claims were not true. In addition, Dominion alleged some Fox News hosts seemingly endorsed the lies and executives allowed it all to happen to placate viewers.\n\nIn the end, the two parties reached a settlement with Fox News agreeing to pay Dominion $787.5 million. Perhaps just as importantly, Dominion made its point: Fox News lied.\n\nJustin Nelson, a lawyer for Dominion, told the media outside the Wilmington, Delaware, courtroom, “The truth matters. Lies have consequences. Over two years ago, a torrent of lies swept Dominion election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories causing grievous harm to Dominion and the country.”\n\nDominion CEO John Poulos told reporters, “Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees and the customers that we serve.”\n\nIndeed, it’s a dark time for Fox News, its reputation severely damaged by not only the settlement but the many details discovered in the weeks and months leading up to Tuesday through depositions and internal emails, text messages and other communications. Those revelations indicated that Fox News knew that false claims were going out over its airways and allowed it to happen to stay in the good graces of its audience and, perhaps, Trump himself.\n\nIn addition, Judge Davis had already ruled in a pretrial hearing that statements Fox News had aired about Dominion were false and that its assertion that they were merely covering the news of what Trump and his advisers were saying could not be used as a defense.\n\nBut a settlement does provide a silver lining for Fox News. Some of its biggest names — including founder and parent company chairman Rupert Murdoch, top Fox News executives, and on-air personalities such as Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo — won’t have to testify. They won’t face embarrassing questions that could have further eroded an already tattered reputation regarding its coverage of the 2020 election and, specifically, Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nThe settlement also allows Fox News to avoid more awful press for the next six weeks — the expected length of the trial.\n\nCNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times all reported that Fox News hosts won’t have to apologize or even acknowledge lies about Dominion on the air. In a statement released right after the judge’s announcement, Fox News acknowledged it had lied, but did not apologize.\n\nThe statement said, “We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nBased on the lack of an apology or on-air acknowledgment, Fox News might see the settlement as not a total loss. However, the monetary figure of more than $787 million is staggering — believed to be one of the largest settlements in a defamation case in U.S. history.\n\nElie Honig, former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, told CNN, “Translated it means ‘we got caught lying by the judge’ — and I think that’s exactly why we are seeing this absolutely jaw-dropping number.”\n\nIt’s about half of what Dominion was asking for in the trial. But Honig said, “I didn’t think there was any way they would get $1.6 billion — even when they proved their case, even if they proved it overwhelmingly to a jury. Let’s remember, by its own estimation, Dominion valued the entire company at somewhere between $30 and $80 million. This settlement is 10 times the value of Dominion as an entire company. That’s how strong a statement this is with this number.”\n\nBut for a public hoping to get a pound of flesh from Fox News or craving to hear Murdoch, Carlson and Hannity squirming under intense questioning, that will not happen. Immediately following Tuesday’s breaking news, the settlement was not mentioned on the air or on the Fox News website. (Fox News’ website did publish a short story later in the evening.)\n\nVeteran media reporter Brian Stelter tweeted, “You could argue that Dominion wins but the public loses.”\n\nBut this does not mean that Fox News can move on. The network’s legal troubles are far from over. Another voting systems company, Smartmatic, has filed a $2.7 billion lawsuit against Fox News.\n\nIn a statement, Smartmatic attorney J. Erik Connolly said, “Dominion’s litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox’s disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest. Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy.”\n\nAnd Dominion isn’t done yet either. Dominion attorney Stephen Shackelford told reporters, “Money is accountability, and we got that today from Fox, but we’re not done yet. We’ve got some other people who have some accountability coming toward them. And we’ll move right on to the next one.”\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday’s settlement is another example of wild conspiracy theories about the 2020 election once again being proven wrong.\n\nCNN commentator David Axelrod tweeted, “This Fox settlement also is one more crushing blow to the conspiracy mongers who tried to steal an election on the basis of false charges and intimidation.”\n\nPortions of this report were published in an earlier story on Poynter.org.",

He did not announce settlement terms. Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said at a press conference after court that Fox settled for $787.5 million. It's unclear the extent of any non-monetary terms to the settlement, but it appears an on-air apology from Fox News hosts is unlikely.\n\nThe voting machine company's suit, which initially sought $1.6 billion dollars in damages, stemmed from the right-wing network's airing of false claims that Dominion was complicit in a nonexistent scheme to rig the 2020 election against the incumbent, Donald Trump, who lost to President Joe Biden.\n\nDiscovery in the case uncovered a trove of stunning internal Fox communications that showed hosts and others in the company were aware that they were airing bogus claims but did so nonetheless, apparently out of fear that viewers would flock to other right-wing outlets, court filings suggested.\n\nLegal observers marveled at the sheer volume of powerful evidence that Dominion amassed against Fox, seemingly putting the ball in the plaintiff's court when it came to a potential settlement.\n\nThat's not to say that a complete victory would have been a sure thing for Dominion, depending upon what it wanted to accomplish. To win at trial, it would have needed to prove not only that the claims were false, but that they were broadcast with \"actual malice,\" meaning with knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard of whether they were true. As a general matter, it's a notoriously tough legal standard for plaintiffs to meet. And even if Dominion won at trial, the amount of damages it would have recovered from Fox wasn't certain.",

                    "snippet": "Fox News settled with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday for over $787 million in what would have been a historic defamation trial in a Delaware court.\n\nWhy it matters: The 11th-hour settlement protects Fox executives from having to possibly testify in court about their role in the network's airing of 2020 election lies.\n\nDetails: \"The parties have resolved their case,\" Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said to the jury around 4:00 p.m., ET, more than two hours after opening statements for the trial were slated to begin.\n\nIn a statement following the settlement decision, Fox News acknowledged that the court found that it aired falsehoods which could have implications for other defamation cases it faces.\n\n\"We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards,\" the company said.\n\nA source has confirmed to Axios that Fox News will not be required to give any apologies or retractions on its air as a part of the settlement deal.\n\nSetting the scene: Fox News executives and its lawyers immediately fled the courthouse after the decision was announced and did not take questions from the press.\n\nDominion lawyers and executives held a press briefing for press outside of the reporters, where attorney Justin Nelson announced that Fox News will pay over $787 million to the company.\n\n“Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and democracy,” Nelson said.\n\nThe big picture: The deal represents the largest media defamation settlement in history.\n\nA $177 million settlement in 2017 between ABC News and Beef Products Inc., a South Dakota meat processing company, was the largest-ever media settlement in the U.S. prior to this agreement.\n\nBe smart: For Fox, a settlement \"would mean setting a precedent of paying when sued for defamation, which would be a bad precedent for them,\" said Shan Wu, a criminal defense attorney,\n\nFox faces several other defamation lawsuits, most notably a $2.7 billion case brought by election technology company Smartmatic.\n\nA settlement prevents Fox from having to face even more potentially incriminating and embarrassing evidence being made public during a trial.\n\nCatch up quick: Legal experts believed that Fox would have faced an uphill battle in court, given how unusually strong Dominion's case was.\n\nThe judge overseeing the trial had already ruled that Fox News made false statements before the trial even started.\n\nBut convincing a jury that Dominion should recieve damages amounting to $1.6 billion, which is the total amount it sued Fox for, may have been much more difficult.\n\nBottom line: \"Dominion Voting Systems seems to want its reputation restored as well as large monetary damages, so any settlement would need to satisfy both these concerns in order to reach an agreement,\" said University of Tennessee journalism professor Stuart Brotman.",

                    "snippet": "In an unexpected and abrupt end to a legal battle that had fascinated the media industry, Fox Corporation and Dominion Voting Systems agreed to settle a much-discussed $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit mere hours after a jury had been seated to consider the matter in Delaware’s Superior Court.\n\nAttorneys for the two sides had been set to deliver opening statements to the jury Tuesday afternoon. But that activity was delayed after Judge Eric M. Davis called for a lunch break. When he finally returned to the courtroom two hours later than originally planned, the matter was moot.\n\n“The parties have resolved their case,” the judge said, without releasing any terms of the agreement between the two sides. Earlier Tuesday, Dominion had asserted it was not backing off its assertion that Fox had caused damages of more than $1.6 billion to its business and operations.\n\nBut in remarks delivered outside the Wilmington, Delaware courthouse, officials and executives from Dominion said Fox had agreed to pay the company $787.5 million — nearly half of what the company had sought in trial. “Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion,” said John Poulos, Dominion’s CEO.\n\nAt issue in the case were damages Dominion alleged it was owed after Fox News aired false claims about its actions and influence on the 2020 election. It is the second legal proceeding made against Fox News for its coverage of the aftermath of the 2020 race for the White House. Smartmatic, a separate voting technology company, has filed a massive $2.7 billion suit against Fox News that is still pending. Both suits alleged that Fox News falsely claimed the companies had rigged the election, repeated items about the matter and then refused to engage in efforts to set the record straight. The 2020 election was not fixed and its results were certified by multiple legal processes\n\nThe legal case had already generated intense scrutiny, with documents, emails and texts from senior Fox executives and well-known Fox News anchors and hosts all suggesting many people at the company knew they were disseminating conspiracy theories around the 2020 presidential election and Dominion Voting’s role in it.\n\nThe trial would have put the inner workings of Fox News on full display. Dominion had been prepared to summon Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Bret Baier from the network, as well as CEO Suzanne Scott and even Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of Fox Corp. himself.\n\n“We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” Fox said in a statement. “This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nSome First Amendment scholars feared the case would undermine libel protections that have been enjoyed for decades by U.S. media, despite acknowledging that Fox likely acted recklessly. Had Fox continued to fight the allegations, they argued, the case might have gone to a higher federal court, where laws governing media might have potentially reworked.\n\nWhether the case will affect perceptions of Fox News by its core customers remains to be seen, but it does not seem likely. Fox News has not covered the case to the extent that media rivals have. And it will not be baking any kind of on-air retraction, according to a person familiar with the matter. Audiences for its programs, like “Tucker Carlson Tonight” and “The Five,” continue to generate more viewers that shows on Fox News rivals like CNN and MSNBC.\n\nEffects are more likely to be seen in the parent company’s stock price. Fox Corp. has said in recent filings that it has $4 billion on hand. Even so, $787 million is no small sum, and Dominion’s victory suggests that Fox will also have to contend with Smartmatic in the not-too-distant future.\n\nVIP+ Survey: Opinions of Fox News Shift Since Defamation Suit",

                    "snippet": "“Settlement before this trove of evidence became public would of course have been in Fox’s best interest,” Ms. Andersen Jones said. “Waiting until the eve of trial, when the whole nation had a chance to focus on what Fox said internally about Trump, its sources and its own viewers, gave Dominion the extra layer of accountability it was seeking.”\n\nIt is uncommon for defamation suits to get to trial, in part because the bar for proving “actual malice” — the legal standard that requires plaintiffs to show that defendants knew what they were saying was a lie, or had a reckless disregard for the truth — is so high. It is rarer yet for one to feature the volume of evidence that Dominion had amassed against Fox.\n\nIn the run-up to trial, Dominion publicly released reams of internal communications among Fox executives, hosts and producers that revealed how the country’s most-watched cable news network set in motion a strategy to win back viewers who had tuned out after Mr. Trump’s loss. The messages tell the story of a frantic scramble inside Fox as it started losing audience share to competitors, like Newsmax, that were more willing to report on and endorse false claims about a plot involving Dominion machines to steal the election from Mr. Trump.\n\nProducers referred to pro-Trump guests like Sidney Powell and Rudolph W. Giuliani as “gold” for ratings and acknowledged that the audience didn’t want to hear about subjects like the possibility of a peaceful transition from a Trump administration to a Biden administration.\n\nThose communications have shown how employees at Fox expressed serious doubts about and, at times, were scornful of Mr. Trump and his allies as they spread lies about voter fraud, questioning the legitimacy of Mr. Biden’s election. Some at Fox mocked Mr. Trump and his lawyers as “crazy” and under the influence of drugs like L.S.D. and magic mushrooms.",

                    "snippet": "Wilmington, Delaware CNN —\n\nThe high-stakes showdown between Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News finally commences in earnest Tuesday when the $1.6 billion defamation trial begins, shining a spotlight on Fox’s election denialism and the toxic role of its disinformation on American politics.\n\nThe trial, initially set to begin with opening statements on Monday, was abruptly delayed on Sunday evening, in an eleventh-hour twist that raised speculation of settlement talks, but ultimately failed to prevent the trial’s open.\n\nIf the 12 jurors side with Dominion and award a sum of money near what the voting technology company is asking for, it would represent one of the largest defamation defeats ever for a US media outlet. A Fox victory — after it limped into trial amid a series of legal setbacks — would be a major triumph for the network.\n\nBut regardless of who emerges the legal victor, the trial promises to be an agonizing affair for Fox News, with the network’s highest-ranking executives and most prominent hosts taking the stand to testify about the 2020 election lies that were promoted on its air.\n\nFor the next six-plus weeks, the center of the media world will run through Wilmington, Delaware.\n\n“In the coming weeks, we will prove Fox spread lies causing enormous damage to Dominion. We look forward to trial,” a Dominion spokesperson said in a statement on the eve of trial.\n\nFox has defended its actions, saying in a statement, “Dominion’s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights.”\n\nFox’s credibility hits all-time low\n\nThe case has already battered the reputation and credibility of Fox News, exposing the network as dishonest, having no regard for the most basic news ethics, and showing contempt for its sizable audience.\n\nPrivate text messages and emails released as part of the case revealed that top executives simply didn’t believe the debunked conspiracy theories they were peddling on-air.\n\nFox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, and prominent hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, knew former President Donald Trump’s lies about the election were wholly detached from reality, but leaned into the voter fraud theories on their shows. Other messages revealed that the handful of journalists at Fox News who did push back against Trump’s lies were disciplined afterward.\n\nThe communications also provided a window into Fox News in the wake of the 2020 election, when throngs of its viewers rebelled against it for accurately calling the election for then-candidate Joe Biden. Messages showed network personnel struggled to appease its angry election-denying viewers, with hosts like Carlson lamenting sowing doubt about the election, but conceding it was what viewers craved.\n\nThat is the heart of Dominion’s case. The company alleges that Fox News knew the lies it promoted about its technology were false, but that the channel allowed the lies to take hold on its air to protect its lucrative business. (Fox denies this.)\n\nHistoric fight over the First Amendment\n\nDominion will try to convince the jury that people at Fox News who were responsible for the 20 lie-filled broadcasts mentioned in the lawsuit knew at the time that they were peddling lies but did so anyway. That would be “actual malice,” a both high and necessary legal benchmark to win a defamation case in the US legal system.\n\nDominion can also prevail by proving that these figures inside Fox may not have intentionally promoted lies, but that they acted with a reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nFox News has contended it did nothing wrong. When Dominion first sued in 2021, the network said it was “proud” of its election coverage. It has argued that it both did not defame Dominion and that the $1.6 billion figure is wildly inflated. They have accused Dominion of cherry-picking internal Fox emails and texts to present a distorted narrative and gin up media coverage from Fox’s competitors.\n\nLawyers for Fox won’t be allowed to put forward many of the First Amendment defenses they were hoping to use, because the judge ruled that they didn’t apply here. One of the strongest remaining strategies could see Fox arguing that hosts like Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo genuinely believed the unhinged conspiracy theories about the 2020 election that they then embraced on their programs.\n\nIndeed, in Dobbs’ deposition for this case, he testified that he still believes the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nPretrial drama\n\nThus far, Fox News has faced an uphill battle in court, as the case careened toward trial.\n\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis, who is presiding over the case, has shown extreme skepticism in recent hearings toward some of the network’s legal theories and courtroom antics. In a series of pretrial rulings, Davis also took away several of Fox News’ key First Amendment defenses, barring them from being made to the jury and making it more difficult for the network to prevail at trial.\n\nEven more alarming for Fox News, in recent days Davis has signaled he is no longer sure whether he can trust the network’s representations in court. Davis appointed a special master to probe whether Fox misled the court about Murdoch’s role at the network, and sanctioned Fox for withholding evidence from Dominion that he believed was “extremely relevant.”\n\nFox has said it never intentionally suppressed any evidence in the case. And, in a remarkable move, lawyers for the network sent an apology to the judge Friday, showing contrition and taking responsibility for the “misunderstanding” that led to the special master’s inquiry.\n\nBut even with these setbacks, Fox may still prevail. Juries are unpredictable, and the verdict must be unanimous. And Fox’s legal team is stacked with seasoned appellate attorneys who surely have their sights set on the Delaware Supreme Court, and maybe even the US Supreme Court, too.\n\nSpin vs. reality\n\nThe inability to distort the truth and bend reality to its will puts Fox News in an unfamiliar position.\n\nThe network often sails through controversy by advancing dishonest narratives about its critics and assailing “the media.” Such tactics will not work in court, where Fox’s lawyers will be professionally obligated to tell the truth and won’t have the fact-free rein that its on-air personalities enjoy.\n\nThe outcome of the trial, however, is not likely to dramatically change the dishonest way in which Fox News operates. The channel is the profit engine in Murdoch’s media empire and its business model is dependent on feeding its viewership a steady stream of right-wing infotainment.\n\nEven as this case has advanced forward in recent days, some top Fox News personalities such as Carlson have yet again shamelessly sowed doubt about legitimacy of the 2020 election.",

                    "snippet": "As RedState reported, and as writers here predicted, Fox News settled with Dominion Voting Systems for an astronomical $787.5 million on Tuesday. That came after a trial delay on Monday gave the two sides more time to come to an agreement.\n\nThe huge settlement was the result of figures going on the network after the 2020 election, accusing Dominion machines of being used to rig the election. That evidence, largely pushed by figures like Sidney Powell, who promised the “Kraken,” never emerged\n\nYou’d think nearly a billion dollars in damages would be enough to satiate, but CNN is really, really upset that this ended up not going to trial. Oliver Darcy and Alyson Camerota took to the airwaves in the aftermath and rhetorically shook their fists at the sky.\n\nCNN's Alisyn Camerota (formerly of Fox) is Big Mad about the settlement. “It’s chump change for Fox… This is a victory for Fox. They don’t have to put their big stars on the stand, and they didn’t even have to issue a public apology!” pic.twitter.com/wG3d8HXJ6h — Bill D'Agostino (@Banned_Bill) April 18, 2023\n\nIt feels pretty weird to be dunking on CNN given that Fox News did actually take a massive blow here. $787.5 million is a ton of money, even for a large, national news outlet. Yet, the hosts over on the liberal network are just so absurd that they always manage to outpace reality.\n\nI mean, listen to Darcy. He actually says that going to trial would have been a trial balloon for “democracy.” What does that even mean? This is the United States of America. Even when free speech turns into defamation, it’s not a threat to democracy. To assert that is outright delusional. I do love the “there were a lot of people that wanted this process to take place” line. Those people are at CNN, and Darcy is one of them. For him to play straight news man, as if he’s just speaking for the masses, is laughable.\n\nCamerota isn’t much better, bemoaning that Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson don’t have to take the stand, delivering CNN red meat for its diminishing viewer base. Fox News did get to skip the public apology, but that’s how most settlements work.\n\nIn the end, this was never about settling a dispute for those at CNN. It was about trying to destroy Fox News, the network that constantly dominates CNN in the ratings, as a shortcut to success. Here’s an idea for the liberal network. Instead of constantly trying to get ahead by silencing other networks, how about the executives over at CNN grow a backbone and start firing the overpaid, unpopular hosts that populate the lineup? They could start with Darcy and Camerota. Continuing to just jumble up the schedule, moving the same chess pieces around obviously isn’t working.\n\nAs to Fox News itself, I honestly don’t know how much this settlement hurts the network over the long term. Someone would need intimate knowledge of their finances and yearly earnings vs. expenses to even speculate on that. I have little doubt, though, that the leadership at the conservative network is going to crack down, specifically on stolen election claims, going forward. That’s going to make some people upset, but when a company is having to shell out $787 million, feelings go out the window.",

                    "snippet": "Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nWhen news of a possible settlement between Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News surfaced on Sunday night, pleas from concerned citizens popped up on social media: Don’t settle this lawsuit, Dominion. Put all the evidence before a jury. Drag Fox News hosts and executives to the witness stand. Grill them on their deceptive programming.\n\nSo, the news Tuesday afternoon that the two parties had settled Dominion’s $1.6 billion defamation suit over election disinformation for $787.5 million will disappoint those who longed for a more visceral comeuppance for Fox News. That’s understandable, considering that Fox News has littered the public square with lies and half-baked stories — essentially mini-Dominions — for 26-plus years.\n\nThe size of the payout, however, speaks to both the journalistic atrocities and the reams of internal correspondence that Dominion pried from Fox News during the pretrial maneuvering. And yet: It all feels a bit empty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustin Nelson, a top attorney for Dominion, sounded a triumphant tone in a statement following the announcement. “The truth matters,” said Nelson. “Lies have consequences. Over two years ago, a torrent of lies swept Dominion and election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories.” The settlement, he added, “represents vindication and accountability.”\n\nFollow Erik Wemple 's opinions Follow\n\nThat accountability came via volume. A Dominion document filed with the court on Tuesday listed 7,021 trial exhibits, including transcripts of offending programs, internal correspondence among producers expressing doubts about the stuff their bosses were broadcasting, scolding remarks about people committed to doing actual journalism, and a lot more. A good portion of the material relates to the actions of former Fox News host Lou Dobbs, a 30-plus-year veteran of cable news. He figures to be among the winners in this settlement, considering that he won’t have to see his propaganda exposed again in what promised to be saturation coverage.\n\nTucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro and Rupert Murdoch are among the others whose spring outlook just got a little brighter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its statement, Fox News demonstrated that not even a court record bulging with evidence of perfidy is enough to shame the organization into genuine contrition. “We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.”\n\n(Boldface added to highlight the network’s minimization of the fact that the discovery materials exposed not just falsehoods but lies. Boldface italics added to highlight an unthinkable proposition — firm evidence that the network refuses to learn from any experience.)\n\nAfter Nelson and other speakers finished addressing the media, the Erik Wemple Blog and other reporters asked whether the settlement required Fox News to publish any retractions or apologies. The lawyers turned and left without answering those questions. The Post’s Jeremy Barr reported that the network will not have to air any retractions or apologies pursuant to the settlement agreement. Which is to say, the resolution requires a great deal of something that Fox News has in wheelbarrows (money) and very little of something it has in teaspoons (editorial integrity).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat’s where the emptiness comes in.\n\nDocuments made public in the course of the litigation showed that Fox News’s relationship with its audience tortures the ideal of an America that runs on a shared set of facts. When Fox News bosses observed that its loyal viewers were fleeing to other networks peddling election lies, they grew worried that their two-decade-long ratings dominance was in jeopardy. So, they fine-tuned the coverage to indulge some conspiracy-theorizing. The upshot is that Fox News was able to keep its audience both sizable and ill-informed.\n\nThe settlement might only perpetuate that dynamic. The full depravity of the network’s 2020 election coverage will never have to be disclosed to viewers on the only cable-news outlet they trust.\n\nThe slam-dunk nature of the evidence in Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News stirred expectations — a bankrupt Fox News; abject apologies from the likes of Carlson and Murdoch — that a single lawsuit may never have been able to deliver. “This litigation cannot solve all problems,” said Nelson.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

                    "snippet": "Attorneys for Dominion Voting Systems speak at a news conference outside the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Del., after a defamation lawsuit against Fox News was settled Tuesday.\n\nDominion Voting Systems’ defamation case against Fox News was settled for $787.5 million at the start of a trial Tuesday. Based on a series of sneak peeks at the damning evidence against Fox developed in pretrial discovery, the lucrative payout wasn’t surprising: The case Dominion was prepared to present was beyond devastating.\n\nThe outcome underscored the tension between the public value of litigation and the private interests driving a lawsuit. Dominion had a killer case against Fox that had many eagerly anticipating a measure of accountability for the network’s knowing support of the lie that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. But the company’s $1.6 billion claim for damages looked high. So the case was ripe for a settlement in which Fox paid a premium to avoid a debacle of a trial, serving the parties’ interests more than society’s.\n\nFox got off fairly lightly given the risks bearing down on it. By most accounts, it can absorb the settlement fairly easily. It’s a reasonable price to avoid the immense damage to its reputation — and consequently its bottom line — that an extended, detailed account of its knowing lies would have occasioned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven before the trial began Tuesday, it was clear that Fox had good reason to avoid it. Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis had already ruled that broadcast claims that Dominion’s voting machines altered the results of the election were false, vaulting the company over the first hurdle defamation plaintiffs face.\n\nThat also would have given Dominion a formidable advantage on the question the parties would have contested at trial: whether Fox aired the statements at issue with “actual malice,” meaning it either knew they were false or recklessly disregarded the question. That’s because many of the statements, by Fox hosts and guests whose claims were presented as well-founded, are ridiculous on their face. The notion that Fox didn’t know they were false would strike any reasonable juror as far-fetched.\n\nCompany Town Fox News reaches $787-million settlement in Dominion defamation suit Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News avoids a potentially embarrassing trial with Dominion Voting Systems over its false reporting on allegations of 2020 election fraud.\n\nIf the trial had proceeded, the jury would have heard even more reasons to find actual malice — a lot more. Some of the most damning evidence consisted of behind-the-scenes emails and texts in which network stalwarts such as Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham admit that they know the Big Lie is just that. Even News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch acknowledged that some of the network’s personalities had crossed a line. So it’s little wonder that Fox settled the case rather than let Murdoch and others take the stand.\n\nThe defenses the company had publicly advanced, moreover, were underwhelming. One was to argue that Dominion “cherry-picked” 20 or so ugly statements that distorted Fox’s generally defensible conduct. But the judge had rightly ruled that defamation must be analyzed statement by statement, rendering Fox’s other statements legally irrelevant. The jury’s attention would have been focused on the offending lies, not the less culpable conduct Fox wanted to highlight.\n\nFox’s other prominent defense was to wrap itself in the 1st Amendment, arguing that the case threatened “protections of the media’s absolute right to cover the news.” But there is no such right, and Fox’s claim was not only faulty but scurrilous. In the landmark press freedom case New York Times vs. Sullivan, which created the actual malice standard, the Supreme Court made it clear that the 1st Amendment exists to promote truthful reporting in support of an informed electorate. The only reason to tolerate false reporting in the absence of actual malice is to give the press breathing room to go after the facts aggressively without fear of liability for innocent mistakes.\n\nFar from serving the goals of the 1st Amendment, Fox’s knowing and reckless publication of lies undermined press freedom and had a terribly corrosive effect on the country. Even settling for hundreds of millions probably saved the company money in the long run compared with the financial and reputational consequences of a train wreck of a trial.\n\nDominion had reason to settle too. While its case against Fox was as strong as that of any defamation plaintiff in memory, its claim for damages was less so given the company’s much smaller estimated net worth . Fox may have paid a premium in damages to avoid the sting of the trial and an unfavorable verdict.\n\nParticularly in the face of consequential trials such as this one, the parties’ motivations — including those of the already exhausted legal teams — tend to realign in favor of settling. That’s especially true once serious talks begin.\n\nA Dominion lawyer claimed in the aftermath that the settlement amounted to “a ringing endorsement for truth and democracy,” adding, “Truth has meaning. Lies have consequences.” And the company wasn’t alone in discerning a triumph of sorts against the Big Lie. But all Fox offered beyond the payout was to wanly “acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false ,” In the absence of any convincing contrition, Dominion’s claim of vindication seems likely to be quickly forgotten.\n\nIt was Fox’s mammoth checkbook, not any civic victory, that allowed it to make Dominion an offer it couldn’t refuse, satisfying the plaintiff’s interest regardless of the public’s. That’s an unavoidable consequence of an adversarial system based on the calculations of private parties.\n\nThe case did incidentally serve the public’s interest by exposing Fox and its personalities through discovery, but not nearly to the extent that it could have through a revealing and damaging trial. Much of the country was looking to Dominion to vindicate basic offenses against the body politic by Trump and his enablers. Now we have to look elsewhere.\n\nHarry Litman is the host of the “Talking Feds” podcast. @harrylitman",

You're about to prove something very big,\" she wrote.\n\nJournalism professor and media commentator Jeff Jarvis pleaded with Dominion to ensure a \"public trial.\" \"Democracy needs Fox on trial,\" Jarvis said.\n\nMSNBC's Mehdi Hasan said the courtroom is the only way to \"stop the 'Big Lie'\" that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump and handed to now-President Joe Biden.\n\nIt was a common sentiment on Twitter: Fox News has disgraced American democracy by pushing lies that the 2020 election was stolen, Fox's detractors say. A reckoning in a courtroom, where a judge has no patience for falsehoods, is an important way to bring a reckoning, these people say. A settlement — on the eve of a trial, no less — would let Fox News escape accountability once again, the argument goes.\n\nIn the cold logic of a court case, though, Dominion has nothing to do with democracy.\n\nA mobile billboard deployed by Media Matters drives past the main entrance of the courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware. Jemal Countess/Getty Images\n\nDominion is a private company founded in Canada and now headquartered in Colorado. It is an item on a balance sheet of a private equity company, Staple Street Capital, which owns a majority of its shares.\n\nThe election technology company filed a civil defamation lawsuit against Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corporation, and asked for $1.6 billion. That money, the company argued, would cover what Dominion said are losses to its business operations as well as security costs for employees who became targets because of pervasive false conspiracy theories that Dominion rigged the 2020 election.\n\nFox will pay $787.5 million to end the case.\n\nDominion also wanted Fox to set the record straight on its broadcasts. While the network did air a bizarre, hostless segment where a professor said there was no evidence the election was rigged, Dominion saw that as laughably unsatisfactory. In an interview with Insider in December 2020, several months before the lawsuit was filed, Dominion lawyer Tom Clare said Fox's retraction and apology should be given the same prominence as its false claims.\n\n\"If you accuse somebody falsely on a prime time slot, or in the host's own voice, or a 10-minute segment, then you need to have equal prominence and equal dignity in the retraction and apology,\" Clare said at the time.\n\nThe exact terms of the settlement are not yet known to Insider, but Dominion CEO said at a press conference Tuesday that Fox has admitted to spreading lies about the technology company.\n\nThat is basically what Dominion wanted: Money and a restored reputation. With those two things in the bag, there's no need for a trial.\n\nEven if Dominion had won at trial, it could have been years before it got paid\n\nA trial, to be sure, would likely have been enormously satisfying for detractors of the conservative media organization. In court filings and courtroom arguments, Dominion said it planned to call hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Maria Bartiromo, Bret Baier, executives Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, Suzanne Scott, Jay Wallace, and other boldfaced names to the witness stand. Court filings spilled numerous embarrassing revelations about the inner workings of Fox News and its relationship with Trump. There is nothing Fox detractors wanted more than to watch its top brass forced to explain themselves in front of a jury — and the American people.\n\nFirst Amendment experts largely agreed that Dominion's case was extraordinarily strong for a defamation lawsuit, which is hard to win in the United States because of strong First Amendment protections. Davis, the judge, also ruled repeatedly in Dominion's favor and admonished Fox's lawyers over withheld evidence.\n\nProtesters outside Fox News's headquarters in New York City. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nBut there was always the risk that a jury, at the end of a six-week trial, just wouldn't agree with Dominion's case. And even if Dominion did win, Fox signaled a plan to appeal, including up to the Supreme Court, which means the case could have been tied up for years before Dominion saw any money.\n\nLegal experts also point out that courtrooms are not perfect vehicles for establishing the entire truth. While they are great at putting new facts on the public record, they are limited by the laws of evidence and the judge's decisions.\n\n\"You'll never get the full picture,\" Jane Kirtley, a professor at the University of Minnesota's journalism school and former executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, told Insider before the trial. \"If you try to use a libel suit as a means to determine what the truth is, it's just not going to be very effective.\"\n\nFox had many incentives to settle, experts say\n\nSome experts had been saying for months that Fox ought to settle and have been puzzled by why the company didn't do so sooner.\n\n\"The facts are just plain terrible,\" James Goodale, a former lawyer for the New York Times and other news organizations, told Insider. \"And when you got really bad facts, you ought to get rid of the thing.\"\n\nA view of the Fox logo outside the News Corp Building in Manhattan. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nOther companies run by the media baron Rupert Murdoch, who owns Fox News, have a track record of settling major lawsuits, including claims for sexual harassment and hacking private voicemails. A Washington Post analysis found that over the past 13 years, Murdoch's companies paid nearly $750 million in settlement funds.\n\nBut just because Fox settled Dominion's lawsuit doesn't mean it's now free of legal risk. It has another major lawsuit pending from Smartmatic, also an election technology company that alleges Fox News and Fox Corporation defamed it when they invited Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani to share election conspiracy theories.\n\nSmartmatic has asked for $2.2 billion in damages for its lawsuit, which also includes Giuliani as a defendant. (It filed a separate lawsuit against Powell, in Washington, DC, federal court, for jurisdictional reasons.)\n\n\"Dominion's litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox's disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest,\" Smartmatic's attorney J. Erik Connolly said in a statement Tuesday. \"Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy.\"\n\nFox News' attorneys are almost certain to be weighing how much the payout to Dominion will affect its dispute with Smartmatic, as well as the prospect it could become the target of future defamation lawsuits if it's seen as caving.\n\nThere are also risks that Fox shareholders will sue the company for settling. One lawsuit, alleging the company violated its fiduciary duties by being named in Dominion's suit in the first place, has already been filed.\n\nRepresentatives for Fox and Dominion both declined to comment on settlement negotiations.",

                    "snippet": "Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems settled their case on Tuesday for $787.5 million, abruptly ending one of the most highly anticipated defamation trials in decades before anyone took the stand. “The truth matters,” Dominion attorney Justin Nelson told reporters outside the courtroom. “Lies have consequences.”\n\nOpening arguments were supposed to begin around 1:30 in the afternoon, after the court took a lunch break. But roughly an hour later, proceedings had yet to resume. “All lawyers appear to be in their seats, but the judge and jury are not seated. Still no updates on why we’re delayed,” tweeted The Guardian’s Kira Lerner, reporting from Wilmington, Delaware. “The scene in the courtroom: It is sweltering, everyone is up from their seats, going in and out of the room. Fox’s lead lawyer, Dan Webb, has taken several phone calls. Some people are standing, all are talking, others gesticulating,” the Times’ Jim Rutenberg reported. Then one hour became two, and just before 4:00, Judge Eric Davis, took the bench and brought the jurors back in the room. “The parties have resolved the case,” he said.\n\nThe end of the Fox-Dominion standoff comes as swaths of reporters had descended this week upon Wilmington, Delaware, and various outlets—including this one—prepared special coverage for what was expected to be a six-week-long trial. Top Fox figures like hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, as well as Fox Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch himself, were expected to take the stand, but no longer.\n\n“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” CEO John Poulos said at the presser outside the courtroom. “Nothing can ever make up for that. Throughout this process, we have sought accountability, and believe the evidence brought to light through this case underscores the consequences of spreading lies. Truthful reporting in the media is essential to our democracy.”\n\n“We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” Fox said in a statement. “This settlement reflects FOX’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nDominion has been steeped in a legal fight with Fox since 2021, when the election-technology company sued the network for $1.6 billion over its 2020 election coverage. Dominion claimed the network amplified election lies pushed by Donald Trump and his allies and knowingly promoted false claims about the company’s role in the election for the sake of juicing ratings and profit. Fox argued its coverage was protected by free speech and press freedom rights, and that it was neutrally reporting on newsworthy claims by a sitting president. (It should be noted that Judge Davis, the Delaware Superior Court judge who was presiding over the case, ruled last week that Fox News could not argue that it broadcast false information about Dominion on the basis of newsworthiness. “Just because someone is newsworthy doesn’t mean you can defame someone,” said Davis.)\n\nWhile the settlement means there will be no such spectacle, the discovery process leading up to this moment has already provided an unprecedented look inside Fox News. Through a deluge of internal communications and private text messages Dominion unveiled during the pretrial process, the public got to see top executives, producers, and stars mocking the unfounded claims and unreliable sources in Trumpworld. “Sidney Powell is lying by the way. I caught her. It’s insane,” Carlson told host Laura Ingraham of the conspiracy-peddling Trump lawyer. “Our viewers are good people and they believe it.” In another filing released as part of the suit, Murdoch is seen admitting that hosts Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, and Lou Dobbs “endorsed” Trump’s bogus claims of election fraud. “I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it in hindsight,” Murdoch said at one point in his deposition.\n\nDavis appeared to repeatedly clash with Fox during the pretrial hearings. At one point last week he told a Fox News attorney that his team had a “credibility problem” upon learning that Fox has delayed the disclosure of Murdoch’s full role at Fox News, a technicality that prevented Dominion from getting access to documents they otherwise would have during the discovery process. It was also during the pretrial hearings that Davis sanctioned Fox News for withholding evidence. Dominion lawyers asserted they’d found out about other documents and material that they should have received during discovery but didn’t. The judge said he would likely start an investigation into the matter.\n\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated with additional developments.",

                    "snippet": "Fox News has settled with Dominion Voting Systems, which sued the network for defamation after it repeatedly aired false claims about the voting-machine company rigging the 2020 presidential election. The settlement is a landmark moment in political media, with the primary news source for millions of Americans admitting it lied about the outcome of a presidential election.\n\nFox paid $787.5 million to skirt a public reckoning for its lies. The settlement means the network will avoid having to trot its highest-profile figures — from Rupert Murdoch to Tucker Carlson and beyond — in front of a jury to testify under oath about their coverage of the 2020 election, which the court has already determined was rife with false claims. The full terms of the settlement have not been made public, but the network will not have to apologize or even acknowledge on air that it was a font of misinformation during a crisis in democracy.\n\nDominion brought the suit in March 2021, seeking $1.6 billion in damages and arguing it suffered financial harm from Fox pushing a narrative that the company helped rig the election in favor of President Biden, despite its executives and on-air personalities knowing there was no evidence to support the claims. The trial, which was scheduled after Fox’s attempts to get the case dismissed were swatted down, had been scheduled to commence Monday.\n\nSigns of a potential settlement agreement seemed to be underway on Sunday, with Judge Eric Davis announcing that he was moving the start of the trial from Monday to Tuesday without explanation. The Wall Street Journal reported that the delay was due to Fox pushing to settle the case out of court. Judge Davis announced the settlement on Tuesday after a long delay following the jury’s selection that morning. “Parties have resolved their case,” he said as media waited for the parties to deliver their opening statements.\n\n“We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” Fox said in a statement. “This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.” Editor’s picks\n\nFox had already lost a series of pretrial rulings in the lead-up to the now-nixed trial, including last month when the court denied the networks’ bid to have the suit thrown out. Judge Davis sanctioned Fox during a pre-trial hearing last week after Dominion’s lawyers accused Fox of withholding evidence, and on Tuesday announced that he had appointed a special master to investigate Fox’s legal team.\n\nPortions of the withheld evidence in question, audio recordings former Fox producer Abby Grossberg made after the 2020 election, were aired last week by MSNBC. They featured a Trump official admitting to Fox that the Dominion voting machines in Georgia showed no “physical issues,” as well as Rudy Giuliani telling Fox host Maria Bartiromo that he was having trouble substantiating claims of election fraud.\n\nThe recordings were only the latest in a damning series of revelations about how Fox covered the aftermath of the election. Internal network communications made public during the litigation demonstrated that network executives and prominent on-air hosts knew there was no real evidence of fraud, but pushed the idea that there was because of concerns about losing their Trump-supporting audience. Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham texted about there was no proof of fraud. Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott emailed about concerns that fact-checking election fraud claims was “bad for business.” Rupert Murdoch admitted in a deposition that Fox hosts “endorsed” false claims of fraud.\n\nThe network also appeared fully aware that there were falsehoods in their coverage of Dominion’s role in the election, as says after the election Fox News information specialist Leonard Balducci circulated materials from Dominion and the Associated Press debunking growing conspiracies about the company. Fox continued to platform unfounded claims by Giuliani and fellow Trump lawyer Sidney Powell anyway. Related\n\nTrump argued ahead of the settlement that the best way for Fox to defang Dominion’s case was to push even more false claims of fraud. “IF FOX WOULD FINALLY ADMIT THAT THERE WAS LARGE SCALE CHEATING & IRREGULARITIES IN THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THEM, & FOR AMERICA, THE CASE AGAINST THEM, WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE EXISTED AT ALL, WOULD BE GREATLY WEAKENED,” the former president wrote Monday on Truth Social.

It agreed to pay Dominion nearly $800 million dollars in damages and, according to Dominion lawyer Stephen Shackelford, the settlement could still include other accountability measures. “Money is accountability, and we got that today from Fox,” he said. “But we’re not done yet, we’ve got some other people who have some accountability coming toward them.”\n\nFox is also battling a similar lawsuit from election technology company Smartmatic, which filed a $2.7 billion defamation suit against the network a month before Dominion filed theirs. “Dominion’s litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox’s disinformation campaign,” Smartmatic said in a statement on Tuesday. “Smartmatic will expose the rest.”",

(Video: Reuters)\n\nListen 7 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nThe long-anticipated defamation trial in Dominion Voting Systems’ lawsuit against Fox News ended before it truly began Tuesday, with a judge announcing the two sides had agreed to a settlement. Dominion says Fox has agreed to pay $787.5 million — nearly half of the $1.6 billion Dominion sought. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight At issue in the case were false claims that Fox aired about Dominion related to former president Donald Trump’s false accusations about the 2020 election being stolen. Dominion had to prove not only that the claims weren’t true — which it did — but that Fox’s actions met the legal standard of “actual malice,” meaning that it knew better or that it showed a reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nThe settlement, the full terms of which weren’t immediately clear and could remain shrouded, will spare Fox a lengthy spectacle delving into those issues. But it came after ugly disclosures about the cable news leader.\n\nBelow are some takeaways:\n\n1. The damage done\n\nThe name of the game for Fox and its owners in such situations — be it the British phone-hacking scandal, sexual misconduct, gender discrimination cases or others — is almost always to settle. Often, and evidently by design, that deprives us of a true hearing on the merits of the allegations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in this case Fox didn’t reach a settlement until after thoroughly damaging revelations via the legal discovery process and early court maneuvers. The documentation in the case showed that many at Fox indeed knew better about the conspiracy theories the network aired, that it chose to air them anyway in the name of appealing to an audience that believed these claims and wanted to believe Trump had won, and that even Fox’s news product toed the company’s political line.\n\nThe judge also ruled that it was “CRYSTAL clear” that the claims Fox aired were false.\n\nWhat will continue to linger over the network are the lessons of all that evidence. Given what we’ve learned about Fox’s focus on its business model, other outlets will view its news product — its journalism — accordingly. It reinforced the idea that the shows put on by Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham are just that: shows tailored to an audience, and they might not reflect what the hosts or the people behind the scenes actually know or believe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps as much as anything, the case reflected the control Trump has over the conservative movement, given the fear Fox demonstrated of what Trump could do to it — a fear that echoes the broader Republican Party’s posture toward Trump.\n\nOf course, whether Fox viewers will ever consume any of that is another matter. Fox covered the trial sparingly after initially barring even its media reporter from weighing in. The conservative media ecosystem is exceedingly insular. Just as Fox capitalized on its audience’s false beliefs about voter fraud — even as such claims had been routinely debunked elsewhere — it will probably benefit from their disinterest in learning what just happened at their favored cable news outlet.\n\nWhat’s clear is that Dominion, while having understandable motives to settle, struck perhaps the most significant blow to date against Fox well before it agreed to the deal.\n\n2. The scale of the settlement\n\nThere remain questions about the settlement beyond the dollar figure. But a big one was answered shortly after it was announced. The Washington Post’s Jeremy Barr reports that Fox says it will not be required to issue an on-air apology. (Dominion’s lawyers did not address this.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is notable that Fox News said in its post-settlement press statement that “we acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.” But that acknowledgment is pretty thin gruel if it’s the only mention Fox gives about its conduct. It’s merely stating something that the court said without necessarily endorsing it. (Fox media reporter Howard Kurtz did say on-air after the settlement that the allegations were “obviously false. Those were conspiracy theories.”)\n\nDominion sought to cast Fox’s statement as more significant, with chief executive John Poulos saying that “Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion.”\n\nBut even if you recognize that Fox was admitting the statements were false, the network did not address whether those statements were lies. “Lies have consequences,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said, adding: “Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the dollar figure, it’s surely one of the largest in history for a defamation suit (the totals in such suits often remain confidential). It also compares to some estimates of the total cost of the phone-hacking scandal last decade that cost Rupert Murdoch’s media empire as much as $1 billion.\n\nFox, which owns the nation’s leading cable news outlet, had $4 billion in cash in its last financial filing, meaning it would seem to be able to cover such a large payout. But it’s a huge blow to the bottom line.\n\n3. What’s next?\n\nAnd it might not be the end of it. While the news of the settlement is hugely significant, there’s more to come — even on this specific issue.\n\nFox still has to contend with a similar lawsuit from another voting technology company, Smartmatic. The company was often lumped in with Dominion while the false claims were made on Fox, and in some cases the claims against Smartmatic arguably went further.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA New York judge last month allowed Smartmatic’s $2.7 billion lawsuit to move forward. The size of the payout in the Dominion case will only make the stakes of this next case even larger.\n\nAnother major issue looming over Fox is what its shareholders might do. Shareholders can sue the network over how its decisions damaged their assets. One of them filed suit this month. Others have demanded company records.\n\nWhile the Dominion payout might not severely hamper Fox, the combination of all of these things could exact a growing and much larger toll. And as far as Fox is concerned, the issue as a whole isn’t completely settled. What just happened suggests it’s not exactly fighting from a position of strength.\n\nDominion says it’s not done, either, with lawyer Stephen Shackelford saying: “We’ve got some other people who have some accountability coming toward them. And we’ll move right on to the next one.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDominion is also suing MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who promoted the false election claims on Fox and elsewhere. (Lindell’s fate would also seem to matter greatly to Fox, given that documents in the Dominion case show Fox referring to him as the network’s top advertiser.)\n\n4. Late missteps from Fox\n\nBefore the two sides were able to reach an agreement, Fox repeatedly earned the ire of the judge, including on Tuesday.\n\nJudge Eric M. Davis removed Fox communications executive and spokeswoman Caley Cronin from the courtroom after she was caught taking pictures. Cameras and tweeting from the courtroom are forbidden during the trial, which is being held behind closed doors.\n\nDavis said that when admonished, Cronin “turned on everybody else” and said others were “actively tweeting in the courtroom.” So Davis took the opportunity to remind everyone of the rules and assure those in the courtroom that they would be enforced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis last week sharply rebuked Fox’s lawyers and ordered an investigation after Dominion said Fox obscured Murdoch’s status as an officer at Fox News and the Fox Corp. Dominion said Murdoch’s actual status would have entitled it to more evidence in the case. Davis said Fox had a “credibility problem” and that the issue might have influenced his own previous decisions.\n\nFox later apologized to the judge while attributing the omission to a “misunderstanding.” Davis earlier Tuesday had appointed a special master to look into whether Fox abided by its obligations to produce the documents and communications it was required to.\n\nThe situations reinforced that the proceedings were a growing headache for Fox — and one Fox had all kinds of reasons to try to get rid of.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

                    "snippet": "This is part of Slate’s ongoing coverage of Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News Network.\n\nAround 3:55 p.m. on Tuesday, right after announcing that an unexpected settlement had been reached in the libel case filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News, Judge Eric Davis looked over at the 24 jurors and alternates who had been selected that very morning for what everyone had expected to be a lengthy trial. “If you’re thinking your presence was a waste of time, it wasn’t,” Davis said. “The situation was resolved, and it was resolved because of you.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think Davis actually meant it. While looks can certainly be deceiving, and while I do not mean to speculate on any of the jurors’ political orientations, the majority-minority jury that was empaneled at the very least did not appear to be a demographically favorable one for Fox News, whose audience is, basically, old and white. Was the prospect of a jury which featured seven Black members and only one white male enough to push Fox back to the negotiating table? Or was the simple fact of the jury’s swearing-in—and the ensuing realization that the trial was really, finally happening—itself enough to jolt Rupert Murdoch into signing off on a deal?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever the settlement came together, the fact that it did so at all came as a real shock to the many reporters who, after Monday’s unfruitful postponement, had resigned themselves to covering this sure-to-be-revealing, probably comical, and most importantly long defamation trial. While the $787.5 million that Fox will pay to Dominion—for broadcasting blatant lies alleging that the company had somehow manipulated the 2020 election results—is quite a bit less than the $1.6 billion the company had asked for, as far as I can tell it’s still one of the largest settlements in American history. That said, it’s also pocket change compared to the reported $1.7 billion Murdoch is said to have paid his second wife when they divorced in 1999, which perhaps puts the whole thing into dismal perspective. The settlement will be painful for Fox News, but it won’t be a death blow—and, critically, the network will no longer have to subject its executives and presenters to questioning under oath in a public setting. (At least in this trial. There’s a defamation lawsuit from another election-tech company, Smartmatic, that’s still pending.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe afternoon’s proceedings began in typical fashion: with author-provocateur Michael Wolff causing a minor scene in the courtroom. “Are you media?” Wolff asked Fox News commentator Ted Williams, who was sitting in the seat that Wolff had occupied during the morning session.\n\nThe settlement will be painful for Fox News, but it won’t be a death blow.\n\n“I am,” was Williams’ brusque reply. “Are you?” After another brief exchange, Wolff realized that he could just as easily sit two seats over—but Williams was unwilling to let the confrontation go. “‘Scuse me,” Williams said a few minutes later. “Why did you feel compelled to ask me that? Y’all don’t believe a Black man can sit here and be media? You didn’t ask a single white person that.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I just asked the person who was in my seat from this morning. That’s it,” said Wolff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“A white man walking up to me and asking me if I’m media. I took offense to it. I wouldn’t do that to you.”\n\n“Well, you might, if you thought I was in your seat.”\n\n“But you must have thought that a Black man sitting here was not media,” said Williams.\n\n“That’s a no-win argument for me,” said Wolff—and for a long time this afternoon, it looked like this entertaining contretemps would be the most dramatic thing to happen inside Judge Davis’ courtroom today.\n\nDavis, who prides himself on being a punctual man, had ended Tuesday morning’s session by announcing that we would reconvene at precisely 1:30 p.m to hear Dominion attorney Stephen Shackelford and Fox attorney Dan Webb deliver opening statements, which were scheduled to last for 75 minutes and 90 minutes, respectively. But after briefly taking the bench a few minutes after 1:30, Davis then returned to his chambers, declining to explain his departure to the gallery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen 2 p.m. came around, Davis was still absent, and the assemblage fell into whispered speculation as to the reasons for the delay. The working theory was that there had been jury issues of some sort. Perhaps a juror had unexpectedly begged off the case during the lunch break, following the lead of the alternate juror in the wrestling T-shirt who had raised his hand and announced that “I’ve been up all night, I can’t do this” immediately after having been sworn in Monday morning. Perhaps one or more jurors had gotten sick? Had their catered lunch been tainted? Was the jury room drowning in rivers of puke? By 2:06 p.m., Shackelford had stood up and begun leisurely pacing, with what I (perhaps inaccurately) pegged as a your-guess-is-as-good-as-mine look on his face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as the minutes ticked by, it became clear that more was going on than just a puking jury. Davis had made clear in the morning that he was intent on ending every day’s session at precisely 4:30 p.m. Once 2 p.m. came and went, it became clear that there wouldn’t be time for both attorneys to make their opening statements today. Once 3 p.m. flew by, I realized that neither attorney would be able to make their opening statement—which would push the opening statements to Wednesday morning, which would further delay the trial. Around 3:15, my seatmate whispered that she’d heard Davis had appointed a special master to investigate whether Fox News had withheld evidence from Dominion in discovery. Could that fact account for the now-almost-two-hour delay?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith no way to use phones or the internet to investigate the special master thing—Davis had banned the use of both in his courtroom—I moved to the back of the room to take the pulse of the court officials and local reporters who were congregating there. “Word is that Murdoch’s approving a settlement and they’ll announce it within the hour,” said a man from the Associated Press. He said it with a smile, though, and nobody else seemed to take the statement seriously, so I discounted it too, and instead fell into conversation with two men named Sean, about the fact that they were both named Sean.\n\n“No one else was named Sean when I was growing up,” said one Sean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“None of my teachers knew how to pronounce it,” said the other Sean.\n\n“You guys were both at the vanguard of Seandom,” I said. We were all going stir-crazy.\n\nBut the ordeal was almost over. At 3:54 p.m., Judge Davis returned to the bench and, wasting few words, announced that the case had been resolved. Twenty minutes later, Dominion and its lawyers had gathered in the plaza outside the Leonard L. Williams Justice Building for an impromptu press conference. “The truth matters,” said Dominion attorney Justin Nelson. “Lies have consequences. Over two years ago, a torrent of lies swept Dominion and election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTuesday’s settlement doesn’t destroy that universe, though. It just makes it a little bit more expensive for Fox News to live on its farthest-out edges. While the network may now think twice about letting the absolute biggest loons come on the air to tell the absolute stupidest lies, it would be foolhardy to presume that this settlement will catalyze any meaningful crisis of conscience at Fox HQ. The 2024 presidential election is in sight, and it’s a safe bet that Fox News will still spend the next 19 months doing what it does best: building multiday-episode arcs out of isolated anecdotes and unwarranted inference, demonizing liberals and the left while pretending that the right is under constant siege, and working its viewers into crisis states over minor cultural controversies. Fox News might now think twice about definitively crossing the line into actionable defamation, but that’s an outcome that the network can learn to live with.\n\n“I like anticlimax, boys,” said one of the reporters in the media room about an hour after the settlement was announced. “It’s better than six fuckin’ weeks of straight pain.” It’s safe to say that the Murdochs feel the exact same way.",

But another company suing it for defamation said Tuesday that it \"remains committed\" to holding the media outlet accountable for what it says are the harms it has caused to democracy around the globe.\n\nBy settling with Dominion Voting Systems on the first day of a planned trial in Delaware, Fox News — for the sum of $787.5 million — avoided the possibility that hosts such as Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity would have to take the stand and answer questions about whether they truly believed the opinions they espoused on television. The judge in the case had already ruled that Fox News had aired demonstrably false claims about Dominion, which originally sought $1.6 billion in damages. (In a statement, Fox News acknowledged the false statements and said the settlement reflected its \"commitment to the highest journalistic standards.\")\n\nDespite ending in a settlement, the Dominion case seriously damaged Fox News' reputation and embarrassed the likes of Carlson, for example, who it was revealed had tried to have a reporter at the network fired for accurately reporting that the 2020 election was not stolen. In internal deliberations, producers and executives admitted that the vote wasn't rigged but expressed concern that they would lose their audience to far-right competitors if they did not promote former President Donald Trump's false claims.\n\nThe risk of further embarrassment has not been completely avoided, however.\n\nIn February 2021, Smartmatic, which sells electronic voting technology, also sued Fox News and those who appeared on the network — including Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell — for defamation, claiming the network had \"damaged democracy worldwide\" by airing false reports suggesting the company had \"fixed and rigged the 2020 election.\"\n\nSmartmatic was the subject of conspiracy theories, many hinging on its connection to Venezuela, with Powell claiming it had helped rig elections there. In fact, Smartmatic blew the whistle on fraud in Venezuela, revealing in 2017 that President Nicolas Maduro had \"manipulated\" the vote for a new, extra-constitutional assembly.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, an attorney for Smartmatic credited Dominion's litigation with shedding light on Fox News' internal deliberations — and promised more of the same.\n\n\"Dominion's litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox's disinformation campaign,\" J. Erik Connolly, an attorney at Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan & Aronoff said in a statement. \"Smartmatic will expose the rest.\"\n\nThe company is seeking $2.7 billion in damages. In addition to Powell and Giuliani, its lawsuit lists Fox News anchors Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro as defendants; Lou Dobbs, a host who left the network in 2021, is also named.\n\nIn February, a New York appeals court, in a 5-0 decision, rejected Fox News' effort to have the case dismissed and ruled that Giuliani and Pirro could remain as defendants. It also opened the door to adding Fox News' parent company, the Fox Corporation, as a defendant. No trial date has been set.\n\nSmartmatic's case against Powell was last year moved to a court in Washington, DC.\n\n\"Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company, and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy,\" Connolly said.\n\nA spokesperson for Fox News did not immediately return a request for comment. In February, however, a spokesperson for the company told Insider the lawsuit was a threat to free speech and a \"flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs.\"\n\nBefore settling with Dominion, Fox News' public relations team said the same thing.\n\nHave a news tip?

The voting software firm was originally seeking $1.6 billion in damages.\n\nWhile Dominion’s legal team noted that “lies have consequences” and the company’s CEO added that Fox “admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage,” the network attempted to place a positive spin on the record-setting settlement.\n\n“We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” the network stated. “This settlement reflects FOX’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward.”\n\nThat statement was just a bit too much for Tapper, who struggled to compose himself while reading it on air.\n\n“Fox putting a positive face on what can only be interpreted as one of the ugliest and most embarrassing moments in the history of journalism,” he said on Tuesday afternoon. Once he began reading the network’s remarks, he immediately chuckled over Fox’s description of the defamation lawsuit over election lies as a “dispute.” Attempting to continue, he apologized to CNN viewers for his inability to stop laughing.\n\n“I’m sorry. This is going to be difficult to say with a straight face,” the veteran anchor declared before reading aloud the portion of the statement in which Fox lauds its “continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Tapper was able to get through the entire statement, it took a few more pauses and guffaws before he saw it to its completion.\n\nShortly after the settlement was reached, CNN reported that part of the terms of the settlement was that Fox News will not have to acknowledge on air that it promoted lies about Dominion during the 2020 election.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

                    "snippet": "So today is the day that the Media Trial of the Century gets underway.\n\nProbably. We think.\n\nAfter a 24-hour delay that fueled rampant speculation that a settlement might be in the works, the $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News by Dominion Voting Systems is expected to get underway this morning in a Wilmington, Delaware, courtroom.\n\nThe delay, at least as of the writing of this newsletter, did not produce a settlement between the two sides. That means that unless there’s another postponement or a truly last-minute settlement, the trial kicks off this morning with jury selection followed by opening statements.\n\nSo was the delay really to allow the sides more time to negotiate a settlement? It would appear so, but how close the sides were (or are) is not known and, for the time being, they are headed to a jury trial.\n\nA potential settlement, which still could happen at any time even after the trial begins, would involve a number of issues, but the biggest could be what Dominion would want monetarily. CBS News’ Scott MacFarlane reported Monday that Dominion and Fox are “hundreds of millions of dollars’” apart when it comes to estimating Dominion’s value and that is a clear roadblock to a settlement at this time.\n\nThat might not be the only obstacle. Dominion, you would assume, would want Fox News to apologize, but what that apology would look like isn’t clear.\n\nThere is incentive on both sides to settle. And reasons to not settle. Let’s look at the pros and cons for each side.\n\nWhy Dominion would settle\n\nMany legal experts believe that Dominion has as strong of a case as they’ve seen when it comes to a defamation claim. So why settle?\n\nSeveral reasons, not the least of which is that juries can be unpredictable. Beyond that, it could be that Dominion is confident that it will win, but not as confident in what the punitive judgment will be. Dominion might think a certain dollar figure guaranteed now is better than an unknown (and potentially lesser) number at verdict.\n\nWhy Fox News would settle\n\nIn a trial that could last as long as six weeks, Fox News potentially could get beat up. It could end up on the wrong end of negative headlines along the way, which it would want to avoid. A settlement also would mean that some of Fox’s biggest names — including founder Rupert Murdoch, other top executives, and on-air hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo — would not have to give potentially embarrassing testimony.\n\nIf Fox News feels queasy about how a trial might end, maybe it figures it would be better to swallow its medicine now instead of having a story full of negative PR drag out for weeks and still end in devastating fashion.\n\nThere’s also a chance the penalties could be even worse than what Dominion is asking for.\n\nWhy Dominion would not want to settle\n\nMost legal observers familiar with these kinds of cases feel Dominion will win. So why settle when proving its case to a jury might be more consequential? If the two sides can’t agree now on what Dominion should receive in damages, Dominion might believe it’s better to go for the whole $1.6 billion in trial than a lesser amount in a settlement.\n\nWhy Fox News would not want to settle\n\nIf Dominion’s settlement demands are too much, why not roll the dice with a jury? Many of the pretrial discoveries through depositions and internal communications have already proven embarrassing for Fox News, so Fox could say, “How much worse can it get?”\n\nThere’s also this: Maybe Fox genuinely believes it can win. Or, at the very least, maybe the network thinks it won’t end up being on the hook for anywhere near $1.6 billion dollars.\n\nNo cameras\n\nAs a reminder, cameras will not be allowed in the courtroom of this trial. Nor will any electronic devices.\n\nCBS News’ Scott MacFarlane reported, “For those worried this will be a spectacle, keep in mind that this will be a spectacle that will be largely invisible. No court cameras in the courtroom. No electronic devices that could communicate out (of) to the courtroom. … So when the superstar witnesses take the stand — possibly Rupert Murdoch, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson — they won’t be doing so to a mass audience. It may just be people already dialed into this issue and already have opinions on this issue. That’s part of the leverage Fox brings to a possible trial starting (today).”\n\nIn addition, NewsNation’s Brian Entin reports that a tent has been erected in the rear of the courthouse. That means high-profile witnesses might be able to drive under the tent and enter the courthouse without being photographed or seen by the media.\n\nInteresting timing\n\nOn Monday, when the trial was supposed to begin, Fox News took out full-page ads in The New York Times and The Washington Post.\n\nThe ads show a graphic with the headline: “Trust Now. More Than Ever.” It then lists a poll that combines what networks viewers watch and which ones they trust, so the results are a bit misleading. According to this chart, Fox News is the most trusted TV network for news at 41%, ahead of ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC and NBC.\n\nYou have to give Fox News credit for having the gall to take out such an ad just as it is getting ready to defend itself against a $1.6 billion defamation suit that many legal experts are predicting it will lose.\n\nFox News-Dominion tidbits and links\n\nThe Washington Post’s Erik Wemple with “Why settling the Dominion lawsuit is so imperative for Fox News.”\n\nNew York Times reporter Nick Confessore appeared on MSNBC and told Katy Tur that there’s one possible reason why Fox News might not settle: “If they go to trial and lose, it’s possible, yes, a court could order an apology or a settlement could include some kind of apology. I think that will be a hard thing for Fox to swallow; they would presumably have to go on the air and have their prime-time hosts who peddled these lies say, ‘I lied to you, I was wrong. I knew it was wrong. I’m sorry.’ It’s hard to imagine that — it would be catastrophic for the network, for any network. I think that’s part of why there’s resistance.” Then again, it’s hard to believe Dominion would agree to a settlement without getting on-air apologies. (Mediaite’s Jennifer Bowers Bahney has more on Confessore’s MSNBC appearance.)\n\nCNN’s Eric Levenson and Marshall Cohen with “Here are the 20 specific Fox broadcasts and tweets Dominion says were defamatory.”\n\nNortheastern journalism professor and media observer Dan Kennedy with “Landmark case? In fact, Dominion’s libel suit against Fox News is pretty simple.”\n\nJournal reporter receives visit\n\nFor the first time since being detained in Russia three weeks ago, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was able to be visited by U.S. officials. Gershkovich is being charged with espionage — a charge the Journal and the U.S. government vehemently deny.\n\nIn a statement, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy said, “He is in good health and remains strong. We reiterate our call for his immediate release.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal’s William Mauldin and Ann M. Simmons have more.\n\nCBC’s Twitter stance\n\nAdd Canada’s CBC as the latest news outlet to step back from Twitter after the social media company labeled it as “government funded.” The CBC tweeted, “Our journalism is impartial and independent. To suggest otherwise is untrue. That is why we are pausing our activities on @Twitter.”\n\nIt added the same message in French.\n\nLast week, NPR, PBS and the BBC all were labeled as “government funded” and all three announced they would no longer tweet from their official Twitter accounts. Individual journalists at those organizations can do as they please when it comes to tweeting.\n\nIn a statement on the CBC website, company spokesperson Leon Mar said, “Twitter can be a powerful tool for our journalists to communicate with Canadians, but it undermines the accuracy and professionalism of the work they do to allow our independence to be falsely described in this way.”\n\nIn the same report on the CBC website, CBC News editor-in-chief Brodie Fenlon said, “It is important to take a moment to assess what Twitter has done. That is why we have pressed pause today on our accounts. Our journalistic independence is the cornerstone of who we are as a public broadcaster. Suggesting otherwise is inaccurate and untrue.”\n\nPost contributor sentenced to lengthy prison term in Russia\n\nVladimir Kara-Murza, an opposition politician and Washington Post Opinions contributor, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison by a Russian court. He was charged with treason for criticizing Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nThe Post’s Robyn Dixon wrote, “The closed trial further highlighted Russia’s isolationist path, as President Vladimir Putin has disregarded Western criticisms of Russia’s human rights abuses and moved to brutally destroy any remnants of his country’s pro-democracy opposition.”\n\nIn his final statement before sentencing, Kara-Murza said, “I’m in jail for my political views. For speaking out against the war in Ukraine. For many years of struggle against Putin’s dictatorship. Not only do I not repent of any of this, I am proud of it.”\n\nFor details on Kara-Murza, his case and his political views, be sure to check out Dixon’s well-reported and all-encompassing story. Also, it’s Jennifer Hassan and Annabelle Timsit with “Who is Vladimir Kara-Murza, the Putin critic sentenced to 25 years?”\n\nLive hit of the day\n\nIt’s quite common for ESPN reporters to do live reports from the road and, because of morning shows and time differences, occasionally they do early-morning live appearances from their hotel rooms.\n\nThat’s what ESPN NBA reporter Brian Windhorst was doing Monday morning until a hotel guest next door had an issue. Windhorst was in his Phoenix hotel room, where it was 6:49 a.m. when he was making an appearance on ESPN’s “Get Up.” Apparently the person next door to Windhorst didn’t want to, uh, get up.\n\nWindhorst was asked on air why he was whispering, and he said, “We all have adverse situations, and apparently someone in the hotel room next to me was not a ‘Get Up’ viewer. And not happy about the early wake-up call here in Phoenix, and let’s just say that messages have been delivered, not in a soft manner.”\n\nWhile the “Get Up” personalities on set back in New York were laughing, Windhorst was asked if the guest next door complained to the manager. Windhorst said, “This individual did not contact the manager. But their point was made very strongly. So, I’m trying to respect my neighbors here in Phoenix.”\n\nAwful Announcing’s Brandon Contes has more, including video.\n\nMedia tidbits\n\nHot type\n\nMore resources for journalists\n\nHave feedback or a tip?

Dominion Voting Systems' defamation lawsuit against Fox News for airing bogus allegations of fraud in the 2020 election is set to begin trial on Tuesday, April 18, 2023, in Delaware. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File)\n\nFox News settled a major defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million on Tuesday, according to the voting machine company that sued the top cable news network.\n\nThe settlement avoids a trial that could have shed additional light on former President Donald Trump’s election lies, revealed more about how the right-leaning network operates and even redefined libel law in the U.S. Here are some things to know about the case.\n\n___\n\nTHE CASE\n\nDominion Voting Systems sued Fox for $1.6 billion , claiming the news outlet repeatedly aired allegations that the company’s voting machines were rigged against Trump in 2020 while knowing the accusations were untrue. Fox contended that it was reporting newsworthy charges made by supporters of the Republican president. The network said it was supported legally by libel standards.\n\nThe judge in the case announced that the two parties had resolved the matter Tuesday, just as opening arguments were scheduled to begin. Fox did not reveal settlement terms, but Dominion said the deal was for $787.5 million .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n___\n\nELECTION DISCONNECT\n\nDenver-based Dominion produced evidence that prominent people at Fox didn’t believe the fraud allegations , even as the network gave Trump’s allies airtime to repeat them. Multiple staffers texted and emailed in disbelief as Trump latched onto increasingly tenuous claims of being robbed by voter fraud. Fox’s Sean Hannity said in a deposition that he did not believe the fraud claims “for one second” but wanted to give accusers the chance to produce evidence.\n\nFox founder Rupert Murdoch, questioned under oath, agreed that the 2020 election, won by Democrat Joe Biden, was free and fair : “The election was not stolen,” he said. Murdoch even wrote on Jan. 5, 2021, to a top executive urging that prominent Fox personalities issue a statement acknowledging Biden’s legitimate win. At the same time, Murdoch acknowledged that Fox hosts such as Lou Dobbs and Jeanine Pirro at times endorsed false claims of election fraud.\n\n___\n\nFOX’S FEAR\n\nThe court papers laid out a profound concern at Fox over the impact of its election night call that Biden had beaten Trump in the battleground state of Arizona — a call that was accurate. Fox scooped its rivals on the call, but it infuriated Trump and many Fox viewers, who expressed their anger and began tuning in to rival conservative media outlets such as Newsmax. Emails and memos released in the case show Fox executives were highly aware of a drop-off in their network’s viewership at the same time that Newsmax was gaining viewers, and the executives viewed that dynamic as a potential threat.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n___\n\nLIBEL LAW\n\nIn its defense, Fox relied on a doctrine of libel law that has been in place since a 1964 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The doctrine has made it difficult for some plaintiffs to prove defamation by news outlets. Public figures, and Dominion fits that standard in this case, have to prove not only that the information reported was incorrect but that the news organization acted with “reckless disregard” about whether it was true or not.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome First Amendment advocates suggested the voting machine company had a strong argument. But they worried that a prolonged legal battle would give the Supreme Court a chance to change libel laws that would weaken protection for all media.\n\n___\n\nJUDGE’S IRE\n\nThe run-up to the trial was rocky for Fox, and not just because the public got a look at such private chatter as primetime host Tucker Carlson saying he “passionately” hated Trump. The trial judge has scolded the network for 11th-hour disclosures about Murdoch’s role at Fox News and about some evidence involving Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo , including recordings of her talking off-camera with Trump’s lawyers.\n\nFox lawyers later apologized to the judge about the Murdoch matter, saying it was a misunderstanding not intended to deceive. Fox, meanwhile, won some legal fights over limiting what jurors could hear, including a ruling that barred testimony about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n___\n\nTRUMP’S INTEREST\n\nTrump took a keen interest in the case, judging by his social media posts. Always concerned about loyalty, and nursing a grudge about the Arizona call, he expressed anger at revelations in the case that many people at Fox not only did not support his fraud allegations but privately disdained them. Trump stepped up his criticism of Fox as the 2024 Republican presidential race gained steam, but he gave recent interviews to Carlson and Hannity.\n\n___\n\nTHE ELECTION\n\nFederal and state election officials , exhaustive reviews in multiple battleground states where Trump challenged his loss , and Trump’s attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Trump’s allegations of fraud also have been roundly rejected by dozens of courts , including by judges he appointed.",

There was a two-hour, behind-closed-doors meeting between Judge Eric Davis and lawyers from both sides. There was a lot of speculation about what was going on,” Kurtz said.\n\n“The jury had already been selected and seated and we thought we were going to open up arguments, but as it turned out the two parties were discussing a settlement. That settlement has now been reached, the amount of the settlement has not been disclosed,” he said, although the $787.5-million figure was widely reported in other outlets’ coverage.\n\nKurtz then read a statement from Fox, which included:\n\n“We acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.’”\n\nKurtz said Dominion had taken risks with its suit. “Dominion would have had to prove actual malice. That’s a high bar in any such case, but at the same time, Dominion was claiming damages not that they would have gotten, such astronomical damages as $1.6 billion. For Dominion if it lost the case, it ends up with zero, and because of the 1st Amendment concerns and the actual malice there that I just mentioned, that would’ve been a roll of the dice for the company that argued that they had been defamed by Fox.”\n\nKurtz then framed the settlement as a loss for those hoping to see Fox endure the embarrassing disclosures that might have come from a long, revealing trial.\n\n“Although much of the media was looking forward to six weeks of, frankly, a lot of people in the mainstream media, anti-Fox, rooting for Fox to lose, they’re now going to be deprived of that opportunity,” he said, “and the rest of us get to go home.”",

                    "snippet": "Justin Nelson, for Dominion Voting Systems, outside court\n\nThe judge in the Dominion Voting Systems’ defamation lawsuit against Fox has said the parties “have resolved their case”. The news came just as the trial was to begin and the judge dismissed the jury. It cuts short a potentially lengthy trial in a case that exposed how the news network chased viewers by spreading false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The judge made his announcement shortly after jurors had been seated and lawyers were preparing to make opening statements for a trial expected to last six weeks. A lawyer for Dominion said the settlement was for $787.5 million dollars (£633.6 million). “The truth matters. Lies have consequences,” said Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson in a news conference outside the courthouse afterwards. Jury selection earlier on Tuesday in the voting machine company’s 1.6 billion dollar (£1.29 billion) defamation lawsuit against Fox News came a day after the judge granted a one-day delay that gave the two sides time to work out a settlement. READ MORE: Ivanka Trump distances herself from controversial dad\n\nArtist court sketch depicting lawyers and Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis\n\nDominion had asked for 1.6 billion dollars, arguing that Fox damaged its reputation by helping to peddle conspiracy theories about its equipment over the presidential contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Fox claimed the sum overestimated the value of the Colorado-based company. Despite settling the case, the judge stressed it was “crystal clear” that none of the allegations about Dominion aired on Fox by allies of former president Donald Trump was true. Records released as part of the lawsuit showed how Fox hosts and executives did not believe the claims by Mr Trump’s allies but aired them anyway, in part to win back viewers who were fleeing the network after it correctly called hotly contested Arizona for Democrat Joe Biden on election night. The settlement will end a case that became a major embarrassment for Fox News. Had it gone to trial, it would have been a stern tests of libel laws that have protected media organisations for over half a century. Several experts said Dominion’s case was among the strongest they had ever seen but there was a real doubt about whether Dominion would be able to prove to a jury that people in a decision-making capacity at Fox could be held responsible for the network airing the falsehoods. Ultimately, there appeared to be too much at risk for both sides to allow them to put the case in the hands of a jury.\n\nFox News presenter Tucker Carlson, host of Tucker Carlson Tonight\n\nDominion accused Fox of libel for repeatedly airing false allegations by Trump allies that its machines and the software they used switched votes to Biden — even though many at the network doubted the claims and disparaged those making them. The company sued both Fox News and its parent, Fox Corp. During a deposition, Fox Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch, who founded the news network, testified that he believed the 2020 election was fair and had not been stolen from the former president. “Fox knew the truth,” Dominion argued in court papers. “It knew the allegations against Dominion were ‘outlandish’ and ‘crazy’ and ‘ludicrous’ and ‘nuts’. Yet it used the power and influence of its platform to promote that false story.” In a ruling at the end of March, Judge Davis called out the news organisation for airing falsehoods, adding that the bogus election claims continued to persist nearly three years on from Mr Trump losing his bid for re-election. “The statements at issue were dramatically different than the truth,” Judge Davis said in his summary judgment ruling. “In fact... it is noteworthy that some Americans still believe the election was rigged.” Fox said in its defence that it was obliged to report on the most newsworthy of stories — a president claiming that he had been cheated out of reelection.\n\nThe settlement avoids a trial that could have shed additional light on former President Donald Trump\n\n“We never reported those to be true,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said. “All we ever did was provide viewers the true fact that these were allegations that were being made.” Dominion’s attorneys argued that Fox made a deliberate decision to repeatedly air the false claims to appeal to viewers. They allowed guests to falsely claim that the company had rigged the election, flipped large numbers of votes to Mr Biden through a secret algorithm, was owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chavez, and bribed government officials. But a mountain of evidence — transcripts, internal memos and emails — was found to be damaging to Fox. Much of it showed a network effectively terrified of its audience after its election night declaration that Mr Biden had won Arizona. The call infuriated Mr Trump and his supporters.\n\nTrending",

This is going to be difficult to say with a straight face,” Tapper said during his show “The Lead” while reading Fox’s statement.\n\nIn making the announcement of the settlement, the network said, “We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nTapper smirked while saying “dispute” in the first line and repeated the word again. He also cracked a smile and a small laugh and apologized before he finished reading the last sentence of the statement.\n\nHe called the settlement, which was reached at about $787.5 million, one of the “most embarrassing moments” in journalism history. Tapper said the amount is an “unbelievable figure.”\n\n“Fox, trying to put a positive face on what can only be interpreted as one of the ugliest and most embarrassing moments in the history of journalism,” he said before reading Fox’s statement.\n\nTapper quoted a lawyer for Dominion as saying that the deal represents “a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.”\n\nFox mocked CNN’s viewership in response to Tapper’s remarks.\n\n“We can’t look at CNN’s awful ratings without laughing and we’re sure Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders feel the same way,” the network said in a statement to The Hill.\n\nDominion sued Fox in 2021, alleging that the network knowingly aired false information that Trump and his allies were saying about the company’s voting machine software.\n\nReleased emails and texts sent by Fox hosts and executives showed them expressing doubts about the validity of Trump’s claims about voter fraud.\n\n—Updated at 6:16 p.m.",

                    "snippet": "It isn’t often that winning $787.5 million is an underwhelming result. But then again, the defamation case of the century doesn’t come around often.\n\nThis afternoon, when opening statements were expected in a lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News, the parties announced a settlement with that astronomical figure. The other terms of the deal have not been made public. Dominion had sought $1.6 billion from Fox for lies the network broadcast about the company, which manufactures election equipment, after the 2020 election.\n\nFor Fox, the result is costly but bearable. Documents produced in discovery in the case show that Fox saw the aftermath of the election as an existential threat, as members of its audience defected to competitors. Today, Fox’s primacy within right-wing media has been restored and those competitors have faded. The network lost the lawsuit, but it survived and won the war.\n\nDominion’s choice to settle comes as a great disappointment to many critics of Fox, and is also probably a smart financial decision. For the critics, this case was about democracy and disinformation and provided an opportunity to hold Fox accountable for years of broadcasting hogwash. For Dominion, it was primarily about business. No matter how lofty the language its spokespeople used, the company didn’t sue to fix the American media landscape.\n\nImagine if the case had gone to trial, Dominion had won the full $1.6 billion, and then the matter had been caught up in years of costly appeals and wrangling. At best, Dominion would have been able to recover the money years from now; at worst, the award might have been reduced or thrown out altogether. Wiser to take the cash on offer. Whether or not Fox has to make some public apology, the network will presumably be very careful not to defame Dominion again.\n\nNone of this is to dismiss the cost to Fox. The settlement is one of the largest defamation payouts in history, and amounts to nearly 6 percent of Fox’s total 2022 revenue. The last-minute sprint to settlement suggests that the company really did not want to put its stars or its executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch, on a witness stand in court. But for Fox, the nine-figure payout has turned out to be the cost of doing business and guaranteeing the network’s existence.\n\nBefore it settled, Dominion did the public a service by revealing so much about Fox’s inner workings through the lawsuit. We learned, for example, that the MAGA star Tucker Carlson “hate[d Donald Trump] passionately” and knew that the Trump lawyer Sidney Powell was “lying.” We learned that Murdoch deemed Trump’s lies about the election being stolen “crazy stuff.” Altogether, the evidence appeared to show that Fox knew well that it was broadcasting false and malicious material.\n\nThe discovery materials also explained why Fox did so: The company was terrified of losing its audience to smaller rivals such as One America News Network and Newsmax. In the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election, Fox was in the vanguard of reporting reality. It was the first network to call Arizona for Joe Biden, and thus to assert that he would defeat Trump. The network’s reporters, who tend to stick closer to the news than its talk-show hosts, debunked lies about fraud.\n\nThe result was an exodus of the viewers who had made Fox into the most powerful news organization in America and by far the leading cable outlet by ratings. For years, some liberals had believed that if Fox simply told the truth, its viewers would change their minds. Instead, they changed the channel.\n\nFox personalities and executives panicked as ratings fell . When one reporter fact-checked a Trump tweet about Dominion, Carlson called for her head. “Please get her fired,” he wrote in a text chat with Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham. “It needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It’s measurably hurting the company. The stock price is down. Not a joke.” Murdoch pushed journalists involved in calling the election for Biden out of Fox.\n\nIn their panicked state, Fox’s leaders may not have realized how costly these decisions could be—either to its own finances or to the country, as the January 6 insurrection demonstrated—but they must have understood that they were taking a risk. Fox executives calculated that they could afford to lose anything but their viewers, including a defamation case, and they seem to have been right.\n\nAs the discovery materials dribbled out, progressives crowed that Fox’s reputation would forever be damaged by the revelation that the channel was knowingly lying to its viewers. Perhaps on the margins that’s true, but hoping for widespread epiphany is naive. The people most likely to see the damaging information already distrust Fox. The network has pointedly avoided discussing the Dominion lawsuit on air (over the objections even of its top media reporter, Howard Kurtz), and many Fox viewers are so siloed that they are unlikely to hear much about the case. Moreover, it’s been clear for years to anyone who was interested in knowing that Fox lies to its viewers. The viewers either don’t care or refuse to recognize what’s going on.\n\nIf Fox can withstand the reputational damage and the monetary cost of the settlement, the real long-term damage from the suit may be that it revealed Fox to be much weaker than it appeared. One theory of Fox is that Roger Ailes recognized a latent interest in news from a conservative perspective and tapped into it. Another is that Fox has constructed a massive, nearly addicted viewership and persuaded it to adopt a particular political worldview. The truth is that these are interrelated: Conservatives were underserved by mass media, but Fox has shown its ability to whip that crowd up and to rally it around particular strains of conservatism.\n\nBut the sequence of Trump’s rise and the Dominion suit show that the network isn’t really in charge. Fox resisted Trump’s strain of conservatism at the start of his presidential run, but it was eventually forced to acquiesce. It initially resisted his election lies, but ultimately embraced them. The viewers hold the real power, and Fox is at their mercy. If even upstarts like OANN and Newsmax, with low production values, amateurish personalities, and shoddy content, could threaten Fox’s hold on its audience, then the channel remains vulnerable to challenges from further to the right.\n\nThat scares executives far more than any cadre of fancy defamation lawyers ever can—and the lengths that they might go to avoid losing their viewers should scare everyone else.",

                    "snippet": "CNN —\n\nThe Big Lie came at a big price.\n\nThe astonishing last-second $787.5 million settlement between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems, which came after the jury had been seated and on the brink of opening statements Tuesday, served as stark reminder that lies have consequences.\n\nThe country suffered the consequences of Donald Trump’s election lies on January 6th. And Rupert Murdoch suffered the consequences of those same lies on April 18.\n\nBut while it is the largest publicly known defamation settlement by a U.S. media outlet ever, the hefty price tag won’t be enough to change Fox News at its core. The right-wing talk channel still sows doubt about the 2020 election to this day. And I’m told by sources that the settlement it reached with Dominion will not require its dishonest personalities to acknowledge reality and issue retractions on the air.\n\nInstead, Fox News will walk away with only having to “acknowledge” its lies in the weaselly worded statement it put out as its lawyers quite literally fled the courthouse while reporters sprinted down the street after them.\n\n“We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” the network said, before having the gall to add the settlement “reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.”\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nOf course, the Dominion lawsuit revealed precisely the opposite. In some ways it is fitting that the statement Fox News issued as a result of its dishonest conduct was dishonest in and of itself.\n\nThe case exposed Fox News as a dishonest organization like never before. It’s hard for any fair-minded observer to consider the channel as anything other than a propaganda profit machine void of the most basic ethics. The case shredded to pieces the little that remained of the talk channel’s credibility.\n\nSome observers hoped this case would proceed to trial, bringing with it accountability and exposing the network even more. It unquestionably would have been an excruciating several weeks for Fox News. The channel’s highest-ranking executives and biggest stars, such as Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, would have been forced to confront how lies they never believed were promoted on the network’s air to its millions of loyal viewers.\n\nOutside the embarrassment Fox News would have suffered, the settlement also spared the company and its executives of being bound by the laws of reality during trial. Normally, Fox News sails through controversy by distorting the criticism it faces and attacking “the media.” That time-tested playbook would not have worked in court, where the judge would have forced the network’s lawyers to present the jury a fact-based argument. In other words, the network would have been forced to enter the true No Spin Zone. And that’s always been a No Go Zone for the channel when confronting crises.\n\nBut it is important to note that this was only the first of Fox News’ legal problems stemming from its mendacious conduct in the wake of the 2020 election. Another voting technology company, Smartmatic, is still suing Fox News, demanding $2.7 billion for the “disinformation campaign” it waged against its company.\n\n“Dominion’s litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox’s disinformation campaign,” the company’s lead attorney, Erik Connolly, said in a statement after the Fox-Dominon settlement was announced.\n\n“Smartmatic will expose the rest.”",

The money from the settlement, one of the largest libel payouts in media history, was just the icing on a cake Dominion had, in many ways, already won.\n\nAnd yet, while Fox doled out an unprecedented sum, they were able to avoid something priceless: the public humiliation of a trial and an apology.\n\nOver the last several months, Dominion has created a valuable historical artifact, publishing an internal trove of messages that showed Fox hosts and executives knew their claims about Dominion were false and advanced them anyway. It was cache that laid bare how America’s most powerful media outlet lies and distorts the truth to whip up its conservative base.\n\n“The interesting and important aspect of this settlement is that it came well after we might have expected Fox wanted it to occur. All of the sordid details from behind the scenes – about what key Fox players said about Fox sources, about Trump, and about the network’s own audience – came to light,” said RonNell Andersen Jones, a first amendment scholar at the University of Utah.\n\n“It seems clear that Dominion was motivated not just to win compensation for its own injury but to have a public-facing accountability for election denialism and disinformation. The timing of the settlement reflects that.”\n\nBut the lack of a six-week trial meant that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Maria Bartiromo, and Jeanine Pirro would not have to own up to their role in spreading dangerous misinformation after the 2020 election. It suggests that lies, no matter how dangerous or insidious, are tolerable as long as you have the money to back it up. “You could argue that Dominion wins but the public loses,” Brian Stelter, the respected media reporter who has written extensively about Fox, tweeted after the settlement.\n\nDespite the hundreds of millions of dollars Fox will have to pay, it appears that it also won’t have to suffer an even more brutal penalty: while the full terms of the agreement were not disclosed, CNN, Axios and the New York Times reported that it reportedly does not contain a clause that forces the network to apologize on air for making false claims about Dominion. Such a statement would have forced America’s most powerful media organization to look its millions of loyal viewers in the eye and tell them that it lied about the 2020 election being stolen, a belief that has now become orthodox among Republicans.\n\n“I’d expected, given the wider public lesson that Dominion said it wanted to teach in this case, that it would have insisted on more acknowledgment or apology in the settlement,” Jones said. She said Fox’s tongue-twisting statement recognizing that the court found its statements about Dominion were false was likely the best concession Dominion was able to get.\n\nThe settlement will not undo the damage done at the local level, where officials continue to face harassment and pressure to get rid of Dominion voting equipment. It’s also unclear if anyone at the network or its parent company will be fired for airing false statements. “The part that I’m interested in seeing is: what does the apology sound like? Who gets fired? What are the consequences inside the company?” said Chris Stirewalt, a former Fox News political director who was fired after correctly calling the 2020 election for Joe Biden, to Semafor after the settlement.\n\nAlready, Murdoch and Fox seem to be brushing off the suit. In its own post-settlement statement, Fox half-heartedly acknowledged it had broadcast false claims about Dominion. “We acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” the company said.\n\nJane Kirtley, a media professor at the University of Minnesota, expressed doubts that the settlement would result in meaningful change at Fox.\n\n“I’m not saying it shouldn’t change things at Fox. But, they seem so convinced that their approach to news is the right one – some would call it arrogance – that I can’t imagine that they feel chastened,” she said.\n\nThere were plenty of good reasons, however, why both sides settled the case. Fox was facing a swell of strong evidence against it – and Dominion may have had a hard time getting a jury to believe it had suffered the full $1.6bn worth of damage.\n\nStill, a settlement may reflect the limits of using defamation as a tool to police misinformation. Defamation law is a field that uses money to address an injury. It can protect an individual or organization that has been reputationally damaged, but may not get at bigger, societal issues.\n\n“We can’t get from this suit one clear answer about the so-called big lie,” Jones said before the trial. “This suit isn’t asking or answering the question, ‘Was the election stolen?’ ‘Did voter fraud take place?’ It’s asking the very specific question of ‘did this news organization tell knowing lies about this company in ways that hurt this company?’”\n\nFox’s legal troubles aren’t over. It still faces a $2.7bn defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting equipment company. It also faces a shareholder lawsuit seeking damages for spreading false claims, as well as a suit from a former employee who says she was coerced into giving misleading testimony in the Dominion suit.\n\nDominion isn’t ending its push for accountability for 2020 lies either. It has ongoing defamation lawsuits against some of the most prolific spreaders of election misinformation: Sidney Powell, Mike Lindell, Rudy Giuliani, Patrick Byrne, as well as One America News Network and Newsmax.\n\nBut will the landmark settlement change anything at Fox? Probably not, said Lee Levine, an attorney who has defended news organizations in defamation suits.\n\n“For Fox, this is, however sadly, a cost of doing business,” he said.",

They were seen walking during his performance.\n\nHow Frank will proceed next week for Coachella's second weekend remains unclear. It also remains unknown why Frank arrived an hour late to his set.\n\nFrank's performance was plagued with problems, which included him arriving 57 minutes late and having to cut his performance short due to the event's 12am curfew.\n\nHe was slammed by critics and fans alike.\n\nVariety's Jeff Miller blasted the showing on Monday morning as he wrote: 'Ocean's set — during which he and his musicians were intentionally obscured by a cadre of people walking in a circle around them, only seen on video projected on custom screens even more massive than those that usually flank Coachella's main stage — was messy, loose, and a near-disaster that will likely go down as one of the most divisive in Coachella history, with flashes of brilliance that only made for a frustrating final outcome: that of disappointment and palpable audience WTF-ness.'\n\n'Justin Bieber praising Frank Ocean's whole Coachella fiasco is such a Justin Bieber things to do,' one fan tweeted\n\nBizarre: Another mused about the pop star calling Ocean's 'level of artistry' unmatched despite the performance being plagued with issues, which included him arriving an hour late to his concert\n\nOthers pointed out that it only took 'one day' for Bieber to speak out against the backlash over Ocean's performance, but he didn't post once to defend 'HIS OWN WIFE after two months of death threats'\n\n'Justin Bieber will really defend Frank Ocean after a day of negativity before he defends his wife who has been receiving death threats for weeks,' a similar tweet read\n\nMiller noted that the artist did sound great when he opened with hit Novacane, however, he was barely seen on giant video screens.\n\nHe also noted that there were were long 'what are we doing next?' pauses which he described as 'pregnant' and came frequently between songs even alleging that the setlist felt like 'mostly a series of of onstage audibles.'\n\nMiller concluded the biting writeup quite the exclamation point as he said: 'Ocean is beloved partially because of his unpredictable nature, and surely his most devoted fans will claim pure artistry as an excuse. That's fine: Ocean should have the freedom to explore his creativity however he wants.\n\n'That said, when it's in front of 100,000 people who have been clamoring to see you for years, having a plan is more than helpful: it's necessary. Hopefully, by next weekend, Ocean will actually have one.'\n\nOuch! TMZ reported Monday the Novacane singer, 35, got into an accident involving a bike used to get around the festival. The injury was not sustained on stage\n\nThat was not the only lukewarm review as The Guardian's Adrian Horton wrote: 'Most confusing and shocking of all, when he walked away after a cover of the Isley Brothers' At Your Best (You Are Love) and announced, offstage, that he'd been informed he'd hit curfew and the show was over. People stayed put, believing it was maybe a bit even after the lights came on. It wasn't, to the shock of many.\n\n'With his first headliner set, Ocean did achieve the rare thrill of true suspense – what was he doing? Where was he going with this? The highs were high; it's a shame the end felt so bitter.'\n\nMikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times wrote: 'Yet the way the show rescaled the dimensions of a headlining festival gig felt like a radical provocation.'\n\nIndependent investigative outlet The Festive Owl took to Twitter to give an alleged explanation of what occurred leading to the hour-long delay.\n\nThe outlet took to the microblogging site to write that according to their sources: 'The stage production was suppose to (and did) contain an ice rink that was constructed and ready to go.\n\n'The stage production was suppose to (and did) contain an ice rink that was constructed and ready to go': Meanwhile Independent investigative outlet The Festive Owl took to Twitter to give an alleged explanation of what occurred leading to the hour-long delay\n\n'Frank decided at the last minute that he no longer wanted it at all. All of the people walking around him at the start of the performance were actually ice skaters, had been practicing for weeks, and were supposed to be skating as part of the production. Coachella had to deconstruct the approved stage (that had been planned and signed off on for months in advance) + melt the entire ice rink and then set it up how Frank decided today with no warning. Which is what you ended up seeing, and caused the hour long delay.\n\n'This all happened when doors had already open for Sunday, and people were securing their spots to see him. If the last minute changes weren't made he wouldn't have performed at all — leaving the festival without a closing headliner.\n\nThe way the performance actually went was just one of the numerous controversies surrounding the admired R&B singer as he had fans at home struggling to contain their frustration as his performance was pulled from the event's live stream, meaning they couldn't tune in.'\n\nDespite it being his first performance in six years, the performer was forced to cut his set short due to local curfew rules.\n\nAnd taking to Twitter to share their frustration, fans fumed that he would 'rue the day' as they demanded new music to make up for it.\n\nIt was a long-awaited performance for Frank, real name Christopher Francis Ocean, as it was the first in six years - after he last sang at the Flow Festival in 2017 in Finland.\n\nIt was a long-awaited performance for Frank, real name Christopher Francis Ocean, as it was the first in six years - after he last sang at the Flow Festival in 2017 in Finland (pictured in 2012)\n\nHe was scheduled to play Coachella in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced a cancellation, and the singer was not available to play during the festival's return last year.\n\nBut the comeback was even more delayed on Sunday as he appeared on stage an hour late, with the reason unknown.\n\nDue to Coachella's usual 12AM curfew on Sunday, he was forced to end the performance early too.\n\n'Guys, I'm being told it's curfew, so that's the end of the show.

                    "snippet": "Not everyone loved Frank Ocean‘s Coachella set. But Justin Bieber sure did.\n\nThe “Ghost” singer took to Instagram on Monday to praise his fellow musician’s festival performance, which divided fans and sparked a wave of speculation about the reclusive recording artist. Ocean headlined Weekend 1, Day 3 of this year’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.\n\n“I was blown away by Frank Oceans Coachella performance,” Bieber wrote.\n\n“His artistry is simply unmatched, his style, his taste, his voice, his attention to detail.. I was deeply moved. It made me want to keep going and get better as an artist. He continues to set the bar high and gave me a night I will never forget! Thanks Frank.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBieber — who has recently taken a break from live shows and called off his Justice world tour in February — was among many who enjoyed Ocean’s first live performance since 2017, which included songs from his hit albums “Blonde” and “Channel Orange.” But others were left unsatisfied after the “Thinkin Bout You” hitmaker started the show an hour late, then appeared to cut his set short due to the city curfew in Indio.\n\n(Coachella organizer Goldenvoice was fined $117,000 for violating the curfew on all three nights of the festival, city officials told Pitchfork. Ocean’s performance ended around 12:25 a.m. on Sunday, breaking the midnight curfew, according to the music publication.)\n\nOcean’s set was also excluded from the official Coachella livestream on YouTube — a bummer for those who couldn’t attend the festival in person.\n\n“Who’s on drugs tonight?” Ocean asked the crowd during the show. “It’s been so long but I have missed you.”\n\nShortly after Ocean performed, rumors began circulating as to why his long-anticipated Coachella set was delayed and dropped from the livestream.\n\nOne widely shared theory speculated that Ocean’s performance was supposed to include an ice rink and ice skaters, but the headliner made a last-minute decision to cut that element from his set.\n\n“Coachella had to deconstruct the approved stage (that had been planned and signed off on for months in advance) + melt the entire ice rink and then set it up how Frank decided today with no warning,” tweeted @TheFestiveOwl, a Twitter user who often posts about music-festival news. “Which is what you ended up seeing, and caused the hour long delay.”\n\nThe same source also alleged that Ocean “personally pulled the plug at the last second on the livestream.”\n\nMusic The 13 best things we saw at Coachella From boygenius’s joyful harmonies to Bad Bunny’s history lesson to Blackpink’s declaration of superstardom, it was a wild and rewarding Coachella.\n\nMeanwhile, Rolling Stone reported that Ocean suffered an ankle injury during rehearsals that caused a delay and prompted the Grammy winner to perform most of his set sitting down. The music publication cited an anonymous source, who claimed that Ocean’s performance actually lasted 15 minutes and four songs longer than originally planned — contradicting the assumption that he shortened his set because of the curfew.\n\nRolling Stone also weighed in on the ice-rink theory by noting that multiple members of Loyola Marymount University’s hockey team posted behind-the-scenes photos from the festival but didn’t come on for Ocean’s set.\n\nRepresentatives for Coachella and Ocean have not responded to inquiries from The Times.\n\nTimes staff writer Kenan Draughorne contributed to this report.",

The show was delayed as the pandemic claimed millions of lives and halted the event industry; Coachella didn’t return until 2022, when Harry Styles, Billie Eilish, and Swedish House Mafia x the Weeknd headlined. 2020 also marked the year Ocean lost his 18-year-old brother, Ryan Breaux, who died in a car crash .\n\nOn Sunday, the reluctant superstar paused the show to acknowledge his late sibling in a moving moment with the audience, telling them that his life had \"changed so much.\"\n\n\"My brother and I came to this festival a lot,\" he said as he recalled his memories of braving the desert with his brother’s encouragement to see Rae Sremmurd.\n\n\"I know he would have been so excited to be here with all of us. I want to say thank you for the support and the years, and the love all this time. Now I’ll get back to the songs.”",

Ocean headlined Coachella 2023 along with Bad Bunny and Blackpink, but his April 16 set proved to be a massive disappointment for fans after he started an hour late, skipped over many fan-favorite songs, performed mostly sitting down and with his back to the crowd and lip-synched to several tracks. He also ran past the Coachella curfew and abruptly ended his set after less than 90 minutes.\n\nWhile Ocean has received pans for his performance, Bieber had nothing but raves for his fellow musician. Bieber, who memorably surprised Coachella in 2019 by joining Ariana Granda’s headlining set, praised Ocean’s artistry and voice in a heartfelt note on social media.\n\n“I was blown away by Frank Ocean’s Coachella performance,” Bieber wrote. “His artistry is simply unmatched, his style, his taste, his voice, his attention to detail…I was deeply moved. It made me want to keep going and get better as an artist. He continues to set the bar high and gave me a night I will never forget! Thanks Frank.”\n\nSources confirmed to Variety that Ocean’s performance was dramatically overhauled in the hours leading up to its start, which my account for why the set felt so off. An elaborate stage production involving an ice rink was constructed, while a group of skaters — who would apparently skate around Ocean and the band during their set — rehearsed for several days and were ready to go until Ocean allegedly called it all off on Sunday afternoon with just hours to go before taking the stage.\n\nReports from TMZ and Rolling Stone claim that Ocean’s performance “was adjusted at the last minute to account for an ankle injury the singer sustained during on-site rehearsals in the week leading up to the festival,” which could explain why Ocean was seated for a lot of his set.\n\nAt this time, Ocean is still scheduled to close out Coachella’s second weekend with a performance on April 23.",

The singer reportedly sustained the injury during on-site rehearsals in the week leading up to the festival, potentially explaining why Ocean arrived an hour after his set was scheduled to begin and spent most of the time sitting down.

Turns out it does, and it really got broken this year. Multiple outlets report that the festival was fined $117,000 for curfew violations on all three nights by the city of Indio, California. Not only did Ocean’s set go 25 minutes past the midnight curfew on Sunday, Bad Bunny and Calvin Harris also went past the Friday and Saturday curfew of 1 a.m. by 25 and 22 minutes, respectively. Per Coachella’s agreement with Indio, going five minutes past curfew costs $20,000, plus $1,000 for each additional minute. That means Ocean and Benito each cost the fest $40,000, while Harris added $37,000 to the tab. Let’s hope they’ve budgeted more for weekend two.",

But one person who had nothing but high praise for the elusive singer’s live presentation was Justin Bieber, who posted an effusive Instagram tribute to the artist he said “deeply” moved him.\n\nNext to an image of Ocean’s face blown up on the stage’s massive screens, Bieber wrote, “I was blown away by Frank Oceans Coachella performance. His artistry is simply unmatched, his style, his taste, his voice, his attention to detail.. I was deeply moved. It made me want to keep going and get better as an artist. He continues to set the bar high and gave me a night I will never forget! Thanks Frank.”\n\nBieber’s plaudit was a rare voice of support about the performance that reportedly confused and disappointed many fans when the livestream of the show was cancelled at the last minute, the artist offered no merch for sale and Ocean took the stage an hour late to sing what was described as a low-energy set of reworked songs from his catalog. Videos showed a seated Ocean and his band mostly obscured by a group of dancers walking in circles around the stage.\n\nOn Monday, Ocean’s team confirmed to Billboard that the enigmatic singer suffered an unspecified ankle injury during on-site rehearsals in the week before the show that required the last-minute scrapping of a planned on-stage ice rink that was built for Sunday night’s headline performance. The skaters cast for the show then still joined Ocean onstage and wore custom Prada puffer jackets, acting as impromptu backup dancers.\n\nOcean was originally slated to headline the 2020 Coachella, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s unclear how the reported injury will impact Ocean’s weekend 2 performance on Sunday (April 23).\n\nSee Bieber’s post below.",

                    "top_image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f86/026/ef7ab6968575eb820c66f8394cc9b7ecb8-coachella.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg",
                    "snippet": "“Ice-cold, baby, I told you” —Frank Ocean Photo-Illustration: Vulture. Photos: Getty Images\n\nAt first, it sounded too random to be true: Frank Ocean’s late, messy Coachella set was supposed to involve … an ice rink? But in the hours and days since the festival’s first weekend ended, more details about the singer’s alleged frozen endeavors have emerged. The rumor began earlier last week when an anon told DeuxMoi that the singer’s performance would involve skating. Later, the Festive Owl cited sources saying that an ice rink was ready to go but that Ocean decided at the last minute he no longer wanted it. TMZ soon corroborated the rink but said Ocean had scrapped it due to an ankle injury. Per TMZ, his team had reportedly spent months planning the stunt and cast over 100 skaters from local hockey teams who rehearsed the show for weeks. (Part of Ocean’s hour-long delay in starting his set apparently came from having to melt the ice and reset the stage.)\n\nBut that still leaves a lot of questions. Like, how does one get an ice rink to Coachella or, for that matter, keep it cold in the California desert? And how much would it cost? To find out, Vulture spoke to Brad Holland, vice-president of Magic Ice USA, which helps make ice rinks for movies and theme parks — but has never done a Coachella set.\n\nIf I reached out to you and said, “This musician I’m working with is playing Coachella, which is in the desert, and he wants to have an ice rink onstage as part of the show,” where would you go from there?\n\nFirst thing I’d ask about is power, because you can’t have an ice rink without electricity. A relatively small sheet of ice requires a lot of electricity to keep cool, particularly in that environment. If their budget is on the lower end, then I would suggest a synthetic rink — it’s the easiest, it’s usually readily available in major markets, and it doesn’t require any electricity. It’s not what you’d want to play a hockey game on, but it’s certainly skateable.\n\nIf the budget is unlimited and electricity is available, then making ice on a stage like that would be no problem. I just want to know the dimensions: How big a stage do you need? What shape do you want it? And how long do I have to put it in and take it out? Real ice takes, minimum, 24 hours to get installed, and that’s if you have a big crew and you’re really working. A synthetic floor can be thrown down in a couple hours.\n\nThe initial report on this ice-rink rumor said they had to melt the stage after deciding they didn’t want it.\n\nIf that’s the case, then that’s a real ice sheet, obviously.\n\nFrank Ocean reportedly wanted around 100 skaters for this. How big of an ice rink would you need for that?\n\nIt depends on what they’re doing. A standard NHL sheet is 17,000 square feet. Now, you can either play a game of hockey with ten players, or you can public skate 700 people on a rink that size. I just can’t imagine what size his would be. I would think for a hundred people to move around … 8,000 square feet or so, to give you enough room to have any sort of choreography. Otherwise, it’d be jammed up.\n\nAnd obviously, this rink would need to be elevated on a stage. Does that make your job harder as far as constructing something?\n\nOddly enough, no. That’s an easier thing. All ice rinks need a level surface on which to be placed. If the rink is out of level, even by an inch, when you’re making the ice sheet, you’ll have an inch of ice over here and none at the other end. And the ice is an insulator. In other words, it doesn’t want to transfer heat. So you want to keep the ice as thin as possible so the refrigeration can work. You want a nice, dead-level surface. In many cases, our clients will just level the land. But in about half the cases, they’ll build a deck.\n\nSo in an ideal world, if you were going to build an ice-rink stage for a music festival, how far in advance would you want to start planning that?\n\nIt depends on the road show and how they’re organized. We’ve done things where Disney has called us on a Wednesday, and then on Saturday we start construction because they’re prepared. They know what they want. We’ve done movies where there’s six months of planning because they want the ice a certain color.\n\nA festival like this where we’re just laying out a sheet of ice and people know what they’re doing, it can go very quickly. They could call us a couple of weeks in advance and we could have the things ready to go because our equipment is modular and that’s what it’s built to do. So it wouldn’t be that much.\n\nWhen Ocean’s performance was happening, it was in the high 70s. How is it possible to have ice out there?\n\nWe use big air conditioners. We drive them down to subfreezing temperatures. Air conditioners typically make cold water, and the cold water is piped into large buildings like high rises and skyscrapers. But instead of using the air conditioners to make cold water, we use anti-freeze and we drive them down to zero or five degrees. We can make ice almost anywhere. The problems that we run into are ambient temperature or how hot it is, but believe it or not, that’s not the real driver. It’s sunlight, it’s wind, it’s rain. If you can cover an ice sheet, just keep it out of the sun and block it from some of the wind, you can make ice easily up to 80, 90 degrees. But you have to be able to shut down a couple of those variables.\n\nIf they had to melt the ice, as Ocean’s team allegedly did, how long would that take?\n\nIf you leave it to melt on its own, it could take quite a while. In an environment like that, I would imagine, it would take three or four days. But I’m sure that they had a heater there. That’s what we do, and that can be done in hours.\n\nYou mentioned earlier that real ice is for an unlimited budget. If you were given enough notice, and it’s the size that you guessed, and you’re going to have to keep it cold in the middle of the California desert, what would that run somebody?\n\nThis is a ballpark figure, but let’s say $150,000 to $200,000. The issue is, though, the additional costs, which we do not bear. Typically, in the desert, that means using diesel. One of these ice rinks can easily burn 50 gallons an hour of diesel. So the energy costs to keep this thing chilled for any length of time become very expensive, very quick. I don’t know how they would’ve gone about it. I can’t imagine they got electric out there. If they have industrial electric, then you’re talking about $20,000 worth of electric. But if you have to make that with a generator, it can be three or four times that.\n\nI haven’t seen an ice rink during an outdoor music-festival performance. Have you?\n\nIt’s the first time I’ve heard of it. We’ve done movies. We just did one with Ryan Reynolds. We’ve certainly worked with all the theme parks. But I have not heard of a popular singer using ice as a prop.\n\nDoes it strike you as a good idea or something that’s worth exploring more?\n\nAs a guy who rents ice rinks, I think it’s a fantastic idea! A guy that sells umbrellas loves it when it rains. But I don’t know if I’m expecting my phone to ring for a lot of these.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.",

The music festival is essentially the spring-summer preview of what we can expect all the \"It\" girls to be wearing. To much surprise, many celebrities kept it simple with their festival attire, including Hailey Bieber. The Rhode Skin founder stepped out in a comfy outfit featuring a simple white tank top, baggy jeans, and gold jewelry, including a sweet nod to hubby Justin Bieber with J and B initial earrings.\n\nWhile Bieber didn’t tag the brand for the adorned hoops, we did do some digging to find a similar style that you can wear in dedication to someone special in your life (or for yourself!). These Pavoi Initial Earrings on Amazon can help you achieve Beiber's Coachella look without breaking the bank. Pavoi is a brand that needs no introduction as it has gone viral several times on TikTok thanks to its affordable but expensive-looking jewelry.\n\nAmazon\n\nShop now: $13; amazon.com\n\nThe lightweight initial hoop earrings come in two color options, 14K gold-plated or rhodium-plated. They’re crafted with sterling silver posts and are hypoallergenic and lead-free. Each pair of earrings come with the same gem-encrusted initial (you can select a letter from A to Z), so if you want two different letters like Bieber’s earrings, you’ll have to purchase two separate pairs. Hundreds of Amazon shoppers have left these personalized hoops five-star ratings, raving that they are “easy to put on” and that the “quality is great.” One customer who bought a matching pair with their daughter said they were “super sturdy” and “don't come off easily,” while another shopper gifted a pair to their girlfriend and said they were “incredibly comfortable” and didn’t turn their ears green. Plus, if for any reason you aren't happy with your purchase, there's a 90-day money-back guarantee.\n\nIn addition to Bieber’s dangly initial earrings, her white raw-cropped tank stood out to me; the basic wardrobe staple is my go-to for spring. To get you closer to replicating the Bieber-approved look, I can recommend my favorite white tank that I stock up on every spring and summer, which looks similar to the one Hailey wore (but is probably a quarter of the price): Artfish Store's Scoop Neck Tank Top. The tank comes in a signature white and 34 other colors and is available in sizes ranging from XS to L. The fabric is lightweight, stretchy, and super breathable. I like that it's a full-length tank for extra coverage on those breezy days, but you can also crop if you want a similar styling to Beiber's raw hem.\n\nAmazon\n\nShop now: $20; amazon.com\n\nGet a similar look to Hailey Beiber's Coachella outfit with Pavoi's $13 earrings and Artfish Store's $20 Scoop Neck Tank Top on Amazon.\n\n",

                    "snippet": "An aerial image of B-22A captured by NASA's Terra satellite on Feb. 2, 2022. (Image credit: NASA/MODIS/Terra satellite)\n\nAn enormous iceberg that first broke off Antarctica's \"Doomsday Glacier\" more than 20 years ago is finally waving goodbye to the icy continent after being freed from the seafloor, which had trapped the ice chunk in place for over a decade.\n\nThe long-lived berg, known as B-22A, is the largest remaining piece of B-22, a colossal icy mass the size of Rhode Island that snapped off Thwaites Glacier — also known as the Doomsday Glacier — in March 2002. During this time, B-22A has retained a lot of its original ice and covers around 1,160 square miles (3,000 square kilometers), which is around twice the size of Houston, Texas.\n\nAfter breaking free from the glacier in the early aughts, B-22A floated freely just off the Antarctic coast until it got caught on a raised section of the seafloor in 2012. The berg became stuck around 32 miles (53 kilometers) from where it was birthed, meaning it averaged a pitiful 1.6 miles (2.6 km) of movement per year, which is one of the slowest average crawls of any iceberg on record, according to NASA (opens in new tab).\n\nBut now, the aging iceberg has been set free and is making up for lost time. Satellite photos from NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites revealed that the berg began to move again on Oct. 24, 2022, according to NASA's Earth Observatory (opens in new tab). As of March 26, B-22A has drifted around 110 miles (175 km) to the northwest, meaning it has traveled more than three times as far in six months than it managed in the previous 247 months.\n\nRelated: Massive iceberg narrowly avoided collision with Antarctic ice shelf\n\nA time lapse of the iceberg moving away from Antarctica between Oct. 24, 2002 and March 26. (Image credit: NASA Earth Observatory)\n\nOnce a large iceberg calves from an ice sheet or glacier, it normally takes only a few years to journey away from polar regions and into warmer waters, where it will eventually break apart. It's rare for the floating ice chunks to stay intact for more than a decade, but it is not unheard of. In March 2013, a massive iceberg named B-15T was spotted 13 years after breaking off from Antarctica , by which time it had circled half the continent.\n\nScientists are particularly concerned about B-22A venturing away from Antarctica because it may impact the stability of the Thwaites Glacier.\n\nStationary icebergs can cool the surrounding waters, which can have a stabilizing effect on glaciers and other ice masses but also harm marine ecosystems if they get stuck further afield, according to the Earth Observatory. In spring 2020, alarms were raised when the world's formerly largest iceberg, A68, became set on a collision course with South Georgia, an island in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Experts feared that the mighty berg would become trapped on the surrounding seafloor, like B-22A, and that its cooling effect would drastically impact the ecosystem there . (A68 eventually broke apart after narrowly missing South Georgia.)\n\nDespite melting slower than originally thought , the Doomsday Glacier remains in a precarious situation, and recent research has shown that its melt rate could rapidly accelerate in the future . Therefore, it is important that researchers monitor any changes that may be triggered by an iceberg's departure.\n\nScientists will also track B-22A as it moves away from Antarctica to see where and when it will break apart. Icebergs can dump a lot of fresh water as they melt, which can impact ecosystems and ocean currents as they slowly die: A68 dumped more than 1 trillion tons [907 billion metric tons] of water into the ocean over a period of three years.",

                    "snippet": "Months from now, after the sense of fizzy overwhelm has lifted and the better-than-expected dust has settled, there will be two moments that recall for me the fire hose of Coachella, beyond the performances and surprises long since blasted across social media and dissected in Reddit threads. The first was a woman in a swimsuit and crocheted cover-up rousing a line of strangers on Friday afternoon with “who’s ready to see Bad Bunny?!” And the second was a snippet heard while dodging people either posing or on their phones in between the giant ferris wheel and trippy, holographic art installations – “how do you take such good pictures?”\n\nSuch was the non-music vibe of the music festival: questionably workable and confidently worn outfits, waiting in line, hype for the headliners, the warmth of desert sun and buzzed strangers. This was my first time at Coachella, but I’ve been on the internet long enough to know certain truths about the festival: it can be chaotic but is slickly run and ever expanding; the headliners could be once-in-a-lifetime or patchy but rarely forgettable. The weekend is as much about the photos and the fashion as the music. Crochet will abound, and Vanessa Hudgens will be there.\n\nThis was borne out (minus Fomo-feeling Vanessa Hudgens) over the festival’s first weekend, its second run-through since the pandemic forced two years off from the annual desert convergence. The fashion was indeed flamboyant and zeitgeisty – butterfly clips and bucket hats and metallic cowboy boots, several remixes of the Euphoria pants, and more variations of a certain Nasty Gal disco chainmail non-top than I could count. I assisted strangers on several photos by the ferris wheel. Other than an hours-long bottleneck for shuttles following Frank Ocean’s bizarre, abruptly truncated set on Sunday evening, the many lines were mostly within reason.\n\nJai Wolf performs at the Sahara tent at Coachella. Photograph: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Coachella\n\nBut beyond the selfies, fashion-watching and the rolling tides of very festival people, Coachella 2023 seemed to continue the event’s embrace of global, ascendant popular music. The crowd was more multilingual and racially diverse than years of Coachella-themed fashion campaigns led me to believe, perhaps owing to precedent-setting headliners – on Friday, the wildly charismatic Bad Bunny kicked off festivities as the first Latino and Spanish-language headliner with a invigorating, justice-minded party that even technical difficulties with guest Post Malone couldn’t derail. A day later, the first Asian and all-female group to headline, K-pop sensations Blackpink, turned up the volume on the weekend with a torrent of militant pop bangers and tightly executed choreography.\n\nWith all the lawn-crossing and rushing from set to set, you could catch wind of the weekend’s victors. People buzzed about Metro Boomin, the storied trap producer who enlisted collaborators Future, John Legend, Don Toliver, 21 Savage, Diddy and The Weeknd for his Friday night set in the Sahara tent, an electrified half-pipe whose track record of hosting breakout EDM and hip-hop acts has earned it a reputation as the beating heart of the festival. The hotly anticipated live performance debut of legendarily reclusive London singer/producer Jai Paul on Saturday was, depending on your attachment to his influential early 2010s demos and leaked 2013 album, either a cathartic triumph or a muddled first (and hopefully not last) attempt.\n\nThe success of a bevy of electronic and house artists (Coachella’s bread and butter) – SG Lewis, the Chemical Brothers, a transcendent appearance by Kaytranada with guests Kali Uchis and Aminé, Fisher and Chris Lake, a sublime sunset performance by Sofi Tukker – depended in part on the ebbs and flows of one’s energy and what substances people were or were not taking. (“Who’s on drugs tonight? Who’s high right now?” said Frank Ocean to cheers during one of his few acknowledgments of the tittering crowd on Sunday night.) As did people’s movements across the mirage-tinged Empire Polo Club’s rapidly deteriorating grass; it is possible to attend Coachella and stick strictly to smaller tents and alcohol-sponsored rooms of ongoing DJ sets, the beats ramping up and down with the highs. (Not to mention the VIP areas circling the grounds’ perimeter, a twice as expensive and assumedly luxurious experience stratifying the crowd and playing on the ever-lucrative desire to go places where other people cannot.)\n\nMetro Boomin, whose set has earned a reputation as the beating heart of the festival. Photograph: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Coachella\n\nSaturday was a triumph of female artists – a kinetic set in the baking sun by Charli XCX, outfitted as a hot alien with guest Troye Sivan; the coronation of heart-on-their-sleeve supergroup boygenius (Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker), hot off the release of their debut album The Record. Red-hot Spanish flamenco singer turned pop star Rosalía delivered on several tracks from her swaggering, voraciously genre-absorbing album Motomami, with a victory lap accompanied by her new fiance, Rauw Alejandro, for their duets Beso and Vampiros. And then, of course, there was the biggest girl group in the world, Blackpink. Calvin Harris, the unofficial fourth headliner who closed out Saturday night, faded into the background.\n\nWhile acts such as Rae Sremmurd (who ran 30 minutes late on Sunday, an unfortunate trend as the first weekend wore on) skewed college-age or teen, there was an uptick from last year in terms of legacy acts with a deep discography. Blondie held down the Mojave tent on Friday with a spin through classics One Way or Another and Heart of Glass, plus an assist from Nile Rodgers on Rapture. Blink-182 reunited its original lineup – Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker – for the first time since 2014 for a set announced at the last minute that packed the Sahara tent. (“There are so many UTIs about to happen this weekend” said Hoppus, one of many crass jokes the group cracked as, related or not, their crowd thinned over the course of a back-loaded set.) True to form, Bjork’s vibe when taking the main stage on Sunday was unlike anything else at this festival – dressed in translucent needles, her hair slicked into fish gills and backed by a full orchestra, her operatic performance was beautifully discordant and typically weird.\n\nDebbie Harry of Blondie. Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Coachella\n\nI left Coachella with the aftertaste of dust and several indelible images: three fists holding up the back of Damon Albarn’s pants as he spent a more than reasonable amount of Gorillaz’s commanding set perched on the stage fence, singing right into the faces of several fans. The cool grace of Ethel Cain, her thundercloud Gothic Americana working on me better than any of her recorded tracks. The feel of a stranger leaning on my leg as we collectively waited an hour beneath the night sky for Frank Ocean. Bracing against the wall of a portable restroom literally rattling to Eric Prydz’s HOLO set. Several women with minimal coverage tops wrapped in metallic thermal blankets against Friday’s chilly wind as if at a marathon, which is not dissimilar from the Coachella experience.\n\nAs with any mass gathering, Coachella reinforced people at their worst (the lawn ended each day pollinated with trash for an army of late-night workers to pick up) and their best (shout-out to Dan, whose friends got a whole section of Ocean’s crowd to help locate him for 20 minutes). Even the sour taste of Ocean’s unceremonious final note couldn’t upset a balance that, ultimately, trends toward headlines and highs.",

However, versions of it are still available on YouTube and Twitter.\n\nThe two-minute song, created by an artist known only as “Ghostwriter”, features simulated verses by Drake and The Weeknd which refer to the pop star and actress Selena Gomez.\n\nGhostwriter, who said the song was created by feeding existing songs by the artists into AI software, wrote on YouTube: “This is just the beginning.”\n\nUniversal, which publishes both artists through its Republic Records label, said it had always embraced new technologies.\n\nBut it added: “The training of generative AI using our artists’ music (which represents both a breach of our agreements and a violation of copyright law) as well as the availability of infringing content created with generative AI on DSPs [digital service providers], begs the question as to which side of history all stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on: the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation.\n\n“These instances demonstrate why platforms have a fundamental legal and ethical responsibility to prevent the use of their services in ways that harm artists.”\n\nIt is not the first time nascent AI technology has been used to clone artists’ music. Other high-profile examples include a version of Adele’s “Easy On Me” that emulated the voice of Kanye West and a cover of a Beyoncé song using Rihanna’s vocals.\n\nBut the fake Drake song is the most successful so far in replicating the artists' real voices.\n\nThe rise of AI poses a major challenge to the music industry as labels grapple with complicated issues around copyright.\n\nMusic companies are concerned about copyright breaches in terms of both the output of AI-generated songs and the input of the tracks used to train the software in the first place.\n\nLast week, the Financial Times reported that Universal had written to streaming services including Spotify and Apple calling for them to block AI services from scraping melodies and lyrics from copyrighted songs.",

                    "snippet": "An AI-generated song featuring the simulated vocals of Drake and The Weeknd that went viral over the weekend was yanked from streaming services after Universal Music Group labeled the tune “infringing content created with generative AI.”\n\nThe song, “Heart on My Sleeve,” racked up 15 million views on TikTok, 275,000 views on YouTube and over 600,000 streams on Spotify after being posted Friday.\n\nHowever, Universal on Monday demanded the sites pull the song because its creation “represents both a breach of our agreements and a violation of copyright law,” according to the BBC.\n\nA link to the song on YouTube now says: “This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Universal Music Group.”\n\n“These instances demonstrate why platforms have a fundamental legal and ethical responsibility to prevent the use of their services in ways that harm artists,” a UMG spokersperson told The Post on Tuesday.\n\nThe song was reportedly created as a publicity stunt by a startup tech firm and posted on TikTok by a user with the handle @ghostwriter before being picked up by other streamers.\n\nThe creator claimed the track — which simulates Drake and The Weeknd trading verses about pop star and actress Selena Gomez — was made with AI software that samples the musicians’ voices.\n\nThe Weeknd and Gomez split up last year after dating for about 10 months.\n\nAt Spotify’s lowest royalty rate of $0.003 per stream, the 629,439 times “Heart on My Sleeve” was streamed generated nearly $1,900, the BBC reported.\n\nUMG pulled an AI-generated song using simulated vocals from Drake (above) and The Weeknd. Getty Images for SiriusXM\n\nThe music label — which reps Drake and The Weeknd, as well as artists like Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber and Billie Eilish — said the viral postings “demonstrate why platforms have a fundamental legal and ethical responsibility to prevent the use of their services in ways that harm artists.”\n\nThe UMG rep told The Post the episode “begs the question as to which side of history all stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on: the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation.”\n\n“We’re encouraged by the engagement of our platform partners on these issues – as they recognize they need to be part of the solution,” the spokesperson added.\n\nInternet sleuths tracked the phony song, featuring fake vocals of The Weeknd (above) and Drake, to a user named Ghostwriter. Getty Images for TW\n\nLast week, Drake found himself in another AI-snafu when he appeared to criticize an AI-generated version of his voice that was included in a song by New York rapper Ice Spice, writing on Instagram, “This is the final straw AI.”\n\nA number of users speculated about who might have created the artificial music, including AppSumo’s Mitchell Cohen.\n\nOn Twitter, Cohen called the AI track “a genius marketing stunt,” adding, “Not by Drake, but by a SaaS (software as a service) startup.”\n\nCohen traced the origins of the track to a TikTok account with the handle @ghostwriter977, tweeting: “This song by Drake and The Weeknd is generated by AI. It’s such a banger, people think it’s maybe a marketing move by Drake. Except, the creator Ghostwriter977 on TikTok (and imaghostwriter on YouTube) keeps mentioning the link in the bio.”\n\nThe accounts were linked to a startup firm called Laylo, which retweeted Cohen’s initial tweet about the song going “viral.”\n\nThe label said, “We’re encouraged by the engagement of our platform partners on these issues.” AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Financial Times recently reported that UMG, which controls roughly one-third of the global music market, told streaming services like Spotify and Apple to “block” companies from using the label’s songs to train their artificial intelligence technology.",

But another track featuring his and the Weeknd’s vocals has stolen some of its thunder: “Heart on My Sleeve,” a song created by artificial intelligence that replicated their vocal likenesses.\n\nThe song racked up over 600,000 streams on Spotify before being taken down on Monday. It’s also no longer available to stream on Apple Music, although it can still be found on YouTube and TikTok on Tuesday morning.\n\nUniversal Music Group, home to both Drake and the Weeknd, released a statement Monday that labeled the song a breach of copyright.\n\n“UMG’s success has been, in part, due to embracing new technology and putting it to work for our artists — as we have been doing with our own innovation around AI for some time already,” the label wrote. “With that said, however, the training of generative AI using our artists’ music (which represents both a breach of our agreements and a violation of copyright law) as well as the availability of infringing content created with generative AI on DSPs [Digital Service Providers], begs the question as to which side of history all stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on: the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic The 13 best things we saw at Coachella From boygenius’s joyful harmonies to Bad Bunny’s history lesson to Blackpink’s declaration of superstardom, it was a wild and rewarding Coachella.\n\nOnline, many fans marveled at the song’s ability to replicate the timbres and cadences of its real-life counterparts.\n\nOver a four-note piano loop, Fake Drake drops references to collaborators Justin Bieber and 21 Savage, while later shouting out superproducer Metro Boomin for “creating the beat.” A vocal model trained to sound like the Weeknd arrives next, mirroring Fake Drake’s melodies.\n\nThe song was created by a TikTok user named Ghostwriter977. His YouTube page features several other artificial intelligence “covers,” including Kanye West singing Drake’s “Passionfruit” and Drake singing Colbie Caillat’s “Bubbly.”\n\nDrake hasn’t commented on “Heart on My Sleeve,” but he did post on his Instagram story a different AI-created song, in which a Drake replicant rapped Ice Spice’s breakout hit, “Munch.”\n\n“This is the final straw A.I.,” Drake captioned the since-expired video.",

                    "snippet": "A song featuring AI-generated vocals purporting to be Drake and the Weeknd has been pulled from streaming services by Universal Music Group (UMG) after going viral over the weekend. The label condemned the song, called Heart on My Sleeve, for “infringing content created with generative AI”.\n\nThe track was originally posted on TikTok by a user called Ghostwriter977 and shared on streaming services under the artist name Ghostwriter. By the time it was removed yesterday afternoon US time (17 April), it had racked up 600,000 Spotify streams, 15m TikTok views and 275,000 YouTube views.\n\nUMG told Billboard magazine that the viral postings “demonstrate why platforms have a fundamental legal and ethical responsibility to prevent the use of their services in ways that harm artists”.\n\nUMG declined to clarify whether it had sent formal takedown requests to the streaming services and social media sites. “The training of generative AI using our artists’ music (which represents both a breach of our agreements and a violation of copyright law) as well as the availability of infringing content created with generative AI on DSPs [digital service providers], begs the question as to which side of history all stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on: the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation,” a spokesperson said. “We’re encouraged by the engagement of our platform partners on these issues – as they recognise they need to be part of the solution.”\n\nLast week, UMG urged streaming platforms to block AI companies from accessing the label’s songs, the Financial Times reported, saying that it had become aware that certain services had been trained on copyrighted music “without obtaining the required consents”, and warned the platforms: “We will not hesitate to take steps to protect our rights and those of our artists.”\n\nThe music industry is beginning to mobilise against the perceived threat of fake songs. In October, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) warned that AI companies were violating copyrights en masse by using music to train their machines. “That use is unauthorised and infringes our members’ rights by making unauthorised copies of our members’ works.” Last month, the Entertainment Industry Coalition published a series of seven core principles regarding the relationship between artificial intelligence and music, detailing the need for AI to “empower human expression” while also asserting the importance of representing “creators’ interests … in policymaking”.\n\nIt is Drake’s second scuffle with an AI-generated song this week. On Friday, the Canadian rapper addressed a version of breakout US rapper Ice Spice’s song Munch that featured a fake verse by him. “This is the final straw AI,” he wrote in an Instagram story. An AI version of his voice has also recently been added to Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s WAP and Don’t by rapper and songwriter Bryson Tiller.",

                    "snippet": "An AI-voiced rap song replicating the voices of the artists Drake and The Weeknd that went viral on Sunday had been taken down from streaming services as of Tuesday morning.\n\nThe song, “heart on my sleeve,” was created by an anonymous musician who goes by ghostwriter. “Heart on my sleeve” features vocals that sound like Drake and The Weeknd as well as Metro Boomin’s signature producer tag. Clips of the song went viral on social media, with one Twitter upload of the song garnering 6.9 million views.\n\nIn a now-deleted TikTok video, ghostwriter explained that AI was used to create the song but did not disclose what program was used. In a comment under the video, ghostwriter said that they wrote the song, then replaced their voice with Drake’s. Typically, a person can make an AI song like this by writing and recording a track, then use an AI model to replace their vocals with a popular artist’s voice.\n\n“i was a ghostwriter for years and got paid close to nothing just for major labels to profit. the future is here,” the artist wrote in another TikTok comment.\n\nGhostwriter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did representatives for The Weeknd or Metro Boomin. A representative for Drake did not comment on the matter.\n\nListeners were impressed by the AI models’ abilities to capture Drake and The Weeknd’s voices accurately. However, the production and existence of the song itself divided people.\n\n“This is scary lol … song is actually good,” one person tweeted.\n\n“His lyrics and song structure was trash, but impressive AI model,” another tweeted.\n\n“i think the new wave of ai music is cool but i don’t think we should be able to distribute these on major platforms for profit,” one person said in a TikTok comment.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, “heart on my sleeve” had been removed from Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Amazon, YouTube and Tidal. The YouTube link for the song reads, “This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Universal Music Group.”\n\nUniversal Music Group (UMG), which represents both Drake and The Weeknd, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nShortly before “heart on my sleeve” went viral, UMG urged streaming services to prohibit artificial intelligence programs from using its copyrighted music to train themselves.\n\n“We have a moral and commercial responsibility to our artists to work to prevent the unauthorized use of their music and to stop platforms from ingesting content that violates the rights of artists and other creators,” UMG said in a statement to the Financial Times. “We expect our platform partners will want to prevent their services from being used in ways that harm artists.”\n\nDrake previously spoke out against an AI-generated cover of him rapping “Munch” by Ice Spice. In an Instagram story posted last Friday, Drake wrote, “This is the final straw AI” in response to the “Munch” dub.\n\nEdward Klaris, a media lawyer and managing partner at Klaris Law, said the song infringes on Drake and The Weeknd’s right of publicity, or the inherent right of an individual to control the commercial use of their likeness.\n\nIn regards to the use of copyrighted songs to train AI models, Klaris said that “we’re all waiting for some court’s decision that’s going to tell us whether training data is OK or not OK.”\n\nWe’re all waiting for some court’s decision that’s going to tell us whether training data is OK or not OK. -Edward Klaris, media lawyer and managing partner at Klaris Law\n\n“Here, they’re using all the pre-existing songs to create new songs,” Klaris said. “And so the Supreme Court could decide it’s not copyright infringement because it’s transformative … or they could say something different, like: ‘It is a copyright infringement. You can’t just take people’s songs and copy them to make new songs that sound just like that.’”\n\nFor now, while streaming services have appeared to fulfill the wishes of UMG, Klaris said they don’t have a legal obligation to block these kinds of AI songs under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives internet service providers some immunity from their users’ content.\n\nAs for the fate of “heart on my sleeve,” it appears ghostwriter is undeterred by the takedowns. In a comment under one of the recent TikTok videos, ghostwriter said, “add your number to the link in my bio & ill text u when it’s back on Apple Music & Spotify. you can’t kill a ghost.”\n\nThe link in ghostwriter’s TikTok bio leads to their Laylo page and prompts visitors to enter their phone numbers so ghostwriter can “send you the Drake Ai song, and a new link if they take it down.”\n\nLaylo is a messaging platform that allows creators and artists to communicate directly with their fans and inform them of new drops. While there was some speculation that Laylo was behind the ghostwriter stunt, the company said in an email statement to NBC News that it was not involved in the creation of the song.\n\nWhile it’s unclear who ghostwriter is and what their motivations are, they assured fans on TikTok that “im just getting started.”",

                    "snippet": "A song featuring AI-generated fake vocals from Drake and The Weeknd might be a scary moment for artists and labels whose livelihoods feel threatened, but does it violate the law? It’s a complicated question.\n\nThe song “Heart on My Sleeve,” which also featured Metro Boomin’s distinctive producer tag, racked up hundreds of thousands of spins on streaming services before it was pulled down on Monday evening, powered to viral status by uncannily similar vocals over a catchy instrumental track. Millions more have viewed shorter snippets of the song that the anonymous creator posted to TikTok.\n\nIt’s unclear whether only the soundalike vocals were created with AI tools – a common trick used for years in internet parody videos and deepfakes – or if the entire song was created solely by a machine based purely on a prompt to create a Drake track, a more novel and potentially disruptive development.\n\nFor an industry already on edge about the sudden growth of artificial intelligence, the appearance of a song that convincingly replicated the work product of two of music’s biggest stars and one of its top producers and won over likely millions of listeners has set off serious alarm bells.\n\n“The ability to create a new work this realistic and specific is disconcerting, and could pose a range of threats and challenges to rightsowners, musicians, and the businesses that invest in them,” says Jonathan Faber, the founder of Luminary Group and an attorney who specializes in protecting the likeness rights of famous individuals. “I say that without attempting to get into even thornier problems, which likely also exist as this technology demonstrates what it may be capable of.”\n\n“Heart On My Sleeve” was quickly pulled down, disappearing from most streaming services by Monday evening. Representatives for Drake, The Weeknd and Spotify all declined to comment when asked about the song on Monday. And while the artists’ label, Universal Music Group, issued a strongly worded statement condemning “infringing content created with generative AI,” a spokesperson would not say whether the company had sent formal takedown requests over the song.\n\nA rep for YouTube said on Tuesday that the platform “removed the video in question after receiving a valid takedown notice,” noting that the track was removed because it used a copyrighted music sample.\n\nHighlighted by the debacle is a monumental legal question for the music industry that will likely be at the center of legal battles for years to come: To what extent do AI-generated songs violate the law? Though “Heart on My Sleeve” was removed relatively quickly, it’s a more complicated question than it might seem.\n\nFor starters, the song appears to be an original composition that doesn’t directly copy any of Drake or the Weeknd’s songs, meaning that it could be hard to make a claim that it infringes their copyrights, like when an artist uses elements of someone else’s song without permission. While Metro Boomin’s tag may have been illegally sampled, that element likely won’t exist in future fake songs.\n\nBy mimicking their voices, however, the track represents a clearer potential violation of Drake and Weeknd’s so-called right of publicity – the legal right to control how your individual identity is commercially exploited by others. Such rights are more typically invoked when someone’s name or visual likeness is stolen, but they can extend to someone’s voice if it’s particularly well-known – think Morgan Freeman or James Earl Jones.\n\n“The right of publicity provides recourse for rights owners who would otherwise be very vulnerable to technology like this,” Faber said. “It fits here because a song is convincingly identifiable as Drake and the Weeknd.”\n\nWhether a right of publicity lawsuit is legally viable against this kind of voice mimicry might be tested in court soon, albeit in a case dealing with decidedly more old school tech.\n\nBack in January, Rick Astley sued Yung Gravy over the rapper’s breakout 2022 hit that heavily borrowed from the singer’s iconic “Never Gonna Give You Up.” While Yung Gravy had licensed the underlying composition, Astley claimed Yung Gravy violated his right of publicity when he hired a singer who mimicked his distinctive voice.\n\nThat case has key differences from the situation with “Heart on My Sleeve,” like the allegation that Gravy falsely suggested to his listeners that Astley had actually endorsed his song. In the case of “Heart on My Sleeve,” the anonymous creator Ghostwriter omitted any reference to Drake and The Weeknd on streaming platforms; on TikTok, he directly stated that he, and not the two superstars, had created his song using AI.\n\nBut for Richard Busch of the law firm King & Ballow, a veteran music industry litigator who brought the lawsuit on behalf of Astley, the right of publicity and its protections for likeness still provides the most useful tool for artists and labels confronted with such a scenario in the future.\n\n“If you are creating a song that sounds identical to, let’s say, Rihanna, regardless of what you say people are going to believe that it was Rihanna. I think there’s no way to get around that,” Busch said. “The strongest claim here would be the use of likeness.”\n\nBut do AI companies themselves break the law when they create programs that can so effectively mimic Drake and The Weeknd’s voices? That would seem to be the far larger looming crisis, and one without the same kind of relatively clear legal answers.\n\nThe fight ahead will likely be over how AI platforms are “trained” – the process whereby machines “learn” to spit out new creations by ingesting millions of existing works. From the point of view of many in the music industry, if that process is accomplished by feeding a platform copyrighted songs — in this case, presumably, recordings by Drake and The Weeknd — then those platforms and their owners are infringing copyrights on a mass scale.\n\nIn UMG’s statement Monday, the label said clearly that it believes such training to be a “violation of copyright law,” and the company previously warned that it “will not hesitate to take steps to protect our rights and those of our artists.” The RIAA has said the same, blasting AI companies for making “unauthorized copies of our members works” to train their machines.\n\nWhile the training issue is legally novel and unresolved, it could be answered in court soon. A group of visual artists has filed a class action over the use of their copyrighted images to train AI platforms, and Getty Images has filed a similar case against AI companies that allegedly “scraped” its database for training materials.\n\nAnd after this week’s incident over “Heart on My Sleeve,” a similar lawsuit against AI platforms filed by artists or music companies gets more likely by the day.",

                    "snippet": "UPDATED: Are you ready for deep-fake-Drake? Many fans are, at least as an amusing lark, as an apparently artificial-intelligence-generated “collaboration” between “Drake” and “the Weeknd” began to go viral over the weekend, for how closely the styles of the two superstars are mimicked in a track titled “Heart on My Sleeve.”\n\nIt’s no joke, though, to artists and labels wondering whether such soundalike tracks can quickly be quashed, and whether gullible fans may have a hard time telling the difference if the trend accelerates.\n\nAs Monday began, “Heart on My Sleeve” was racking up enough listens and views that it appeared to be on track to become a charting song when this week’s chart results are released next Monday. However, DSPs began deleting the track during the day, presumably under pressure from Universal Music Group. After initially disappearing from Tidal and Apple Music, it also became invisible in Spotify search results and was “greyed out” as unplayable on a bookmarked page.\n\nUniversal provided Variety with a statement about how it plans to deal with AI-generated music, but the company did not respond specifically to requests for comment on whether it was issuing takedown notices for “Heart on My Sleeve.” But that finally became clear when YouTube became the last of the major DSPs to remove the song, with a message that read: “This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Universal Music Group.”\n\nWhich leads to the question: If the song itself is an original composition, can you copyright a voice? Universal, obviously, would answer that in the affirmative — and there’s legal precedent for that position dating back before the advent of AI — although it seems inevitable the issue will wind up in courts.\n\nThe mystery account behind the AI song, identifying as Ghostwriter, left no clues about how the imitative track was brought into being, or what information was fed into programs to create it. But in two minutes and 16 seconds, “Heart on My Sleeve” consists of two distinct verses and a chorus sung by voices distinctly resembling the two stars, with lyrics referring to Selena Gomez, who was reported to have been dating the Weeknd in the mid-2010s. Sample lyrics: “I came in with my ex like Selena to flex, aye / Bumpin’ Justin Bieber the fever ain’t left, aye”… And, “Talkin’ to a diva yeah she on my nerves / She think that I need her, kick her to the curb ‘ All I know is you could’ve had the world … yeah, you were my world.”\n\nSome are wondering if Drake and the Weeknd were picked arbitrarily for such a convincing cloning — which seems plausible, given their reigning superstar status — or if they were particularly selected for prodding because Drake and Universal Music Group have shown a public antipathy toward AI in the creation of soundalike music in recent weeks.\n\nLast week, UMG asked the major streaming services to block AI companies from “scraping” the music they host to create imitations. Drake posted a headline about that, along with a mention of a viral recording that had what sounded like his voice rapping the lyrics to Ice Spice’s “Munch,” with the caption, “This is the last straw AI.” It seemed as though Drake’s comment at the time might have been tongue-in-cheek, but it’s possible he’ll have a less tolerant attitude now that original songs are being released using a facsimile of his vocal likeness.\n\n“Heart on My Sleeve” is credited on Spotify to Ghostwriter, who has a verified account despite having posted only this single track. There, as of Monday at 10 a.m. PT, it was shown as having picked up 253,900 listens from 161,100 users. The names of Drake and the Weeknd do not appear in the artist or track descriptions, but word of mouth is obviously drawing a crowd.\n\nOn YouTube, “Heart on My Sleeve” had 197,000 views after two days. On that platform, Drake’s and the Weekend’s names are included in the song’s subtitle, as “(Drake AI Song feat. The Weeknd).”\n\nThe Ghostwriter account vowed: “This is just the beginning.” Comments from YouTubers under the video include: “This would literally go No. 1 on the charts if Drake released it.” “If you told me this was just an unreleased song I’d believe it.” “I wish I could be a fly on the wall when Drake himself first hears this. This slaps.” And: “What a time to be alive.”\n\nA spokesperson for Luminate said that any chart positions for “Heart on My Sleeve” — assuming it continues to pick up in streaming and does not become the subject of a takedown notice — will have to wait a week, due to the track coming out toward the beginning of the current chart eligibility period.\n\nUniversal Music Group issued a statement to Variety Monday afternoon in response to a request for comment, without addressing the new song specifically. “UMG’s success has been, in part, due to embracing new technology and putting it to work for our artists–as we have been doing with our own innovation around AI for some time already,” the company said. “With that said, however, the training of generative AI using our artists’ music (which represents both a breach of our agreements and a violation of copyright law) as well as the availability of infringing content created with generative AI on DSPs, begs the question as to which side of history all stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on: the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation. These instances demonstrate why platforms have a fundamental legal and ethical responsibility to prevent the use of their services in ways that harm artists. We’re encouraged by the engagement of our platform partners on these issues–as they recognize they need to be part of the solution.”\n\nAlthough the technology used to create such high-level fakery is fairly new, plenty of other such tracks preceded “Heart on My Sleeve” to the starting gate.\n\nEDM artist David Guetta posted a clip with more than a million views that shows him playing a track using what sounds like Eminem’s voice. “I’m not releasing it commercially, obviously,” he wrote in the parentheses in the very title of the Eminem-soundalike number on YouTube.\n\nJay-Z’s longtime engineer, Young Guru, responded to phony Jay-Z vocals on AI tracks by writing, “On one hand I’m well aware that you can’t stop technology. Once the genie is out of the box you can put him back in. On the other hand we have to protect the rights of the artist. Not only artist but everyone in society. … People (are not) able to take your name, image and likeness without permission. We have to add the voice to this law.”",

                    "snippet": "New York CNN —\n\nUniversal Music Group — the music company representing superstars including Sting, The Weeknd, Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande — has a new Goliath to contend with: artificial intelligence.\n\nThe music group sent urgent letters in April to streaming platforms, including Spotify (SPOT) and Apple Music, asking them to block artificial intelligence platforms from training on the melodies and lyrics of their copywritten songs.\n\nThe company has “a moral and commercial responsibility to our artists to work to prevent the unauthorized use of their music and to stop platforms from ingesting content that violates the rights of artists and other creators,” a spokesperson from Universal Music Group, or UMG, told CNN. “We expect our platform partners will want to prevent their services from being used in ways that harm artists.”\n\nThe move by UMG, first reported by the Financial Times, aims to stop artificial intelligence from creating an existential threat to the industry.\n\nArtificial intelligence, and specifically AI music, learns by either training on existing works on the internet or through a library of music given to the AI by humans.\n\nUMG says it is not against the technology itself, but rather AI that is so advanced it can recreate melodies and even musicians’ voices in seconds. That could possibly threaten UMG’s deep library of music and artists that generate billions of dollars in revenue.\n\n“UMG’s success has been, in part, due to embracing new technology and putting it to work for our artists — as we have been doing with our own innovation around AI for some time already,” UMG said in a statement Monday. “However, the training of generative AI using our artists’ music … begs the question as to which side of history all stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on.”\n\nThe company said AI that uses artists’ music violates UMG’s agreements and copyright law. UMG has been sending requests to streamers asking them to take down AI-generated songs.\n\nDifficult to control\n\n“I understand the intent behind the move, but I’m not sure how effective this will be as AI services will likely still be able to access the copyrighted material one way or another,” said Karl Fowlkes, an entertainment and business attorney at The Fowlkes Firm.\n\nNo regulations exist that dictate on what AI can and cannot train. But last month, in response to individuals looking to seek copyright for AI-generated works, the US Copyright Office released new guidance around how to register literary, musical, and artistic works made with AI.\n\n“In the case of works containing AI-generated material, the Office will consider whether the AI contributions are the result of ‘mechanical reproduction’ or instead of an author’s ‘own original mental conception, to which [the author] gave visible form,’” the new guidance says.\n\nThe copyright will be determined on a case-by-case basis, the guidance continued, based on how the AI tool operates and how it was used to create the final piece or work.\n\nThe US Copyright Office announced it will also be seeking public input on how the law should apply to copywritten works the AI trains on, and how the office should treat those works.\n\n“AI companies using copyrighted works to train their models to create similar works is exactly the type of behavior the copyright office and courts should explicitly ban. Original art is meant to be protected by law, not works created by machines that used the original art to create new work,” said Fowlkes.\n\nBut according to AI experts, it’s not that simple.\n\n“You can flag your site not to be searched. But that’s a request — you can’t prevent it. You can just request that someone not do it,” said Shelly Palmer, Professor of Advanced Media at Syracuse University.\n\nFor example, a website can apply a robots.txt file that works like a guardrail to control which URL’s “search engine crawlers” can access a given site, according to Google. But it is not a full stop, keep-out option.\n\nGrammy-winning DJ and producer David Guetta proved in February just how easy it is to create new music using AI. Using ChatGPT for lyrics and Uberduck for vocals, Guetta was able to create a new song in an hour.\n\nThe result was a rap with a voice that sounded exactly like Eminem. He played the song at one of his shows in February, but said he would never release it commercially.\n\n“What I think is very interesting about AI is that it’s raising a question of what is it to be an artist,” Guetta told CNN last month.\n\nGuetta believes AI is going to have a significant impact on the music industry, so he’s embracing it instead of fighting it. But he admits there are still questions about copyright.\n\n“That is an ethical problem that needs to be addressed because it sounds crazy to me that today I can type lyrics and it’s going to sound like Drake is rapping it, or Eminem,” he said.\n\nAnd that is exactly what UMG wants to avoid. The music group likens AI music to “deep fakes, fraud, and denying artists their due compensation.”\n\n“These instances demonstrate why platforms have a fundamental legal and ethical responsibility to prevent the use of their services in ways that harm artists,” the UMG statement said.\n\nMusic streamers Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora did not return request for comment.",

                    "snippet": "This is The Legal Beat, a weekly newsletter about music law from Billboard Pro, offering you a one-stop cheat sheet of big new cases, important rulings and all the fun stuff in between.\n\nThis week: A fake Drake song featuring AI-generated vocals highlights legal uncertainty over artificial intelligence; the rapper Cam’ron becomes the latest music star to face a copyright lawsuit over using a photo of himself; Megan Thee Stallion makes bold new accusations in her long legal battle against her record label; and much more.\n\nRelated Fugees Rapper Pras Launches Defense in Campaign Finance Trial\n\nTHE BIG STORY: Fake Drake Debacle & The AI Fight Ahead\n\nA new song featuring AI-generated fake vocals from Drake and The Weeknd went sensationally viral over the weekend, underscoring growing concerns over the impact of artificial intelligence on the music industry and highlighting the legal uncertainties that surround the new technology.\n\nThe track, “Heart On My Sleeve,” featured voices that were uncannily similar to those of the two superstars — a trick the anonymous creator says was accomplished by using artificial intelligence. By Monday evening, the track had been mostly pulled from the internet, but not before racking up hundreds of thousands of spins on streaming platforms and millions of views on social media.\n\nAs evidenced by the speedy removal, artists and labels already have pretty good legal tools to police something as blatant as “Heart On My Sleeve.” Experts say the song potentially violates the rights of publicity of the two stars by mimicking their voices, and that it also possibly used an unauthorized sample of Metro Boomin’s producer tag.\n\nBut the incident came just days after news broke that Universal Music Group had asked streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music to stop AI companies from accessing the label’s copyrighted songs to “train” their machines, and that issue poses far bigger questions — about the extent that AI can be legally used to create new music that isn’t a clear copycat of specific superstars — with fewer clear answers.\n\nFor a full breakdown of all this week’s developments, including expert commentary on the issue, go read our entire story here.\n\nTHE OTHER BIG STORY: Cam’ron Copyright Conundrum\n\nBack in 2003, a photographer snapped a shot of the rapper Cam’ron at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Show in New York, where he wore a pink fur coat and hat while holding a matching flip phone. Pink would go on to become a signature color for the rapper, who released a bright pink collab sneaker with Reebok in 2016; GQ later ran an entire article called “Cam’ron Is Very Particular When It Comes to the Color Pink,” underneath the same 2003 image of his “iconic pink mink coat.”\n\nNow, twenty years later, that image has become something of a problem for Cam.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed last week, the photographer who snapped it claimed that the rapper had slapped the image on a huge range of commercial products sold by his Dipset Couture brand, ranging from t-shirts to shower curtains to decorative pillows to socks — all without getting any kind of license from her.\n\nThese kinds of cases happen a surprising amount. Miley Cyrus, Dua Lipa, Justin Bieber and a slew of other stars have also been sued in recent years after they re-used photos of themselves snapped by someone else. That’s because the copyright to such a photo is owned by the photographer, not the person featured in it.\n\nBut the lawsuit against Cam’ron is potentially more serious than those earlier cases. To understand why, go read our full story, complete with all the legal documents filed in the case.\n\nOther top stories this week…\n\nLIVE NATION WINS FESTIVAL CASE – A federal appeals court rejected a lawsuit claiming Live Nation was “stringing along” a country singer when the company considered — but ultimately passed on — her proposal for an all-female country music festival in Chicago. “An expression of interest in participating in a project is not a promise to do so,” the court said.\n\nNICK CARTER FACING NEW ABUSE LAWSUIT – Backstreet Boys member Nick Carter was hit with another sexual abuse lawsuit, this time from Melissa Schuman — a former member of teen-pop group Dream who has long claimed the singer assaulted her.\n\nMEGAN’S NEW ATTACK – Megan Thee Stallion hurled bold new accusations at her record label 1501 Certified Entertainment, claiming the company’s leaders are trying to make themselves “judgment-proof” by draining 1501’s bank accounts.\n\nREMEMBER NFTS? – Lil Yachty reached a settlement with a non-fungible token (NFT) seller called Opulous over allegations that the company used his name and likeness without permission to raise over $6.5 million in venture capital funds.\n\nORCHESTRA SHOWDOWN IN PHILLY – Citing “unlawful, anticompetitive and predatory conduct,” the Philly Pops accused the Philadelphia Orchestra of violating federal antitrust laws by abusing its control over local concert venues and ticketing services to try to crush its smaller rival.",

                    "snippet": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 18 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) have raised concerns with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) after learning that sexually explicit photographs could be accessed by children on the popular Kindle app and called on Amazon to strengthen its content moderation.\n\nThe warnings were sparked by questions posed by Reuters to spokespeople at the three companies about users’ ability, via the Kindle app, to access and view online volumes of photographs of naked women, with titles such as “75 hot fully nude photos of a young blonde” and “Real Erotica: Amateur Naked Girls – Vol. 4\". Some appeared to show women and men engaging in sexual acts.\n\nThe companies said their concerns were around policy violations but did not provide more details of how their rules were broken or about their warnings to Amazon.\n\nReuters learned of the issue when two families told Reuters their pre-teen sons downloaded the explicit material via Amazon's Kindle Unlimited e-book subscription service and viewed the full-color photographs on the Kindle iPhone app. Pornography also is available through Amazon's Kindle online store and viewable on versions of the Kindle app.\n\nThe parents, who declined to be named, told Reuters they were initially attracted to the $10-per-month service because it offered access to age-appropriate book series that would otherwise be expensive to purchase and were not available on Amazon's Kids+ subscription service.\n\n“We’re committed to providing a safe shopping and reading experience for our customers and their families and we take matters like this seriously,\" said Amazon in a statement to Reuters. \"We are reviewing all of the available information and are taking action based on our findings.”\n\nReferring to Amazon, Apple said, “We’ve shared these concerns with the developer and are working with them to ensure their app is compliant with our guidelines.”\n\nGoogle in a statement said that \"Google Play does not allow apps that contain or promote sexual content and we've been in contact with the developer on this issue.\"\n\nSuch exchanges are rare among tech companies which, while competitive, also rely on one another for a variety of services. The Kindle and Amazon apps are consistently among the most downloaded on Google's and Apple's app stores.\n\nThe adult material at issue is primarily self-published through Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing arm. Authors can self-publish their books nearly instantaneously through Amazon and may designate the content as available for the Kindle Unlimited service. In Amazon’s terms for its self-publishing arm, it says it can refuse to sell content it deems “offensive or inappropriate,” which may include content that “contains pornography.”\n\nAmazon is the world's leading e-book distributor, controlling two-thirds or more of the market, according to some estimates. E-books can be viewed on black-and-white Kindle devices but also in full color on the Kindle mobile app.\n\nThree internet law experts interviewed by Reuters said that Amazon was unlikely to face legal ramifications, given First Amendment protections.\n\nEric Goldman, a Santa Clara University law professor, said there's a body of law that broadly protects distributors of pornography and other potentially objectionable materials even if it might end up in the hands of minors, comments that were echoed by the other two experts.\n\nAGE RATINGS AND PARENTAL CONTROLS\n\nAfter Reuters alerted Apple of the availability of pornography in the Kindle app, Amazon earlier this month changed the age rating in the app store to 12 years or older from 4 years or older. The app is rated \"teen\" on Alphabet's Google Play store.\n\nThe companies can, at their discretion, remove an app from their app store for rules violations or other reasons. And Apple and Alphabet have in the past policed their app stores for disallowed adult material, including removing apps that displayed explicit content or ads.\n\nThere are no parental controls available for the Kindle Unlimited service.\n\nThe Apple app store’s guidelines “prohibit apps dedicated to portraying overtly sexual or pornographic material,” the company said in a statement. “App developers are responsible for moderating the user-generated content on their platforms, and we work with developers to take immediate corrective actions whenever we find any issues.”\n\nAmazon said it was also updating the Kindle app, without offering specifics, and noted that its terms require parental involvement for users under 18.\n\nDINOSAUR AND ALIEN EROTICA\n\nKindle Unlimited, for $10 per month, offers users a mix of self-published e-books and more traditional fare from publishing houses. The service has grown in popularity for customers seeking to binge read series like the “Hunger Games” trilogy and other prior bestsellers like “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Queen’s Gambit.”\n\nKindle Unlimited also has spawned a cottage industry of self-published titles catering to a wide range of interests, including text-based erotica, with many thousands of titles in niche areas, including dinosaur and alien erotica. Pornographic content can be found on Amazon's site without a subscription and purchased for as little as $2.99.\n\nAmazon generally allows authors to self-publish online without interference and will respond to credible complaints regarding copyright, content or other issues by removing the book, according to three people who have worked in the Kindle division. Amazon has software tools to help detect some disallowed content prior to publication.\n\nThe people said the Seattle tech company has stricter guardrails for its Amazon Kids+ service but noted that’s designed and marketed for children aged 3 to 12, leaving Kindle Unlimited as the lone subscription service option for customers seeking book content aimed at 13 to 17 year olds.\n\nAs of Monday, adult materials were still accessible on Kindle and Kindle Unlimited via the iOS and Android apps.\n\nReporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Indigo De Souza's next album, All of This Will End, is out on April 28.\n\nNext up is \"Cherie Vico,\" a charming, sweet song from Nashville-based musician Peter One. The 67-year-old singer from Côte d'Ivoire had a career in West Africa before moving to the United States, and now after 20 years of working in other fields – he's been a security guard, a teacher and most recently a nurse – he's finally releasing music again.\n\nAfter that, we hear new music from two beloved rock bands: Speedy Ortiz has released \"Scabs,\" its first new song in five years, which sounds like it may have been influenced by bandleader Sadie Dupuis' solo recordings. In a statement, Dupuis said the tart, wiry track was inspired by a desire for stronger political convictions in others. And next we hear Bully's Alicia Bognanno sing about the death of her dog and the unconditional love and support that her pet brought her. The song \"Days Move Slow\" is from Bully's fourth album Lucky for You, which is out June 2.\n\nWe end the show with a couple of new artists. Charlotte Cornfield's song \"Cut and Dry\" reflects on the idea of leaving things behind as part of moving on and the difficulty of severing ties with the past. And our final song comes from Laura Wolf, a classical musician also in love with sound manipulation. I'll play the creative-sounding tune \"Calligraphy and Calculations\" from her upcoming album Shelf Life.\n\nFeatured Artists And Songs:\n\n1.

Viral trends like the milk crate challenge and the blackout challenge have for years circulated online, mainly on TikTok, resulting in FDA warnings, death, and lawsuits.\n\nThe Stevens family is asking lawmakers to put age restrictions on medication like Benadryl, and are warning other parents of the dangers of these kinds of TikTok challenges, Justin Stevens told ABC. He also said he thinks TikTok itself should have an age restriction.\n\n\"Keep an eye on what your kids doing with that phone, talk to 'em about, you know, the situation. I want everybody to know about my son's situation,\" Justin Stevens said.\n\nIn a warning on their website, Benadryl said their product should only be used as directed, adding that they are working with TikTok to remove content where the product is misused. In September 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued its own warning about the trend.\n\nTaking too much Benadryl can \"lead to serious heart problems, seizures, coma, or even death,\" the FDA said.\n\nIn a statement, TikTok said: \"Our deepest sympathies go out to the family. At TikTok, we strictly prohibit and remove content that promotes dangerous behavior with the safety of our community as a priority. We have never seen this type of content trend on our platform and have blocked searches for years to help discourage copycat behavior. \"",

                    "snippet": "Written by Lianne Kolirin, CNN\n\nA German artist has rejected an award from a prestigious international photography competition after revealing that his submission was generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nBerlin-based Boris Eldagsen won the creative open category at this year's Sony World Photography Award with his entry \"Pseudomnesia: The Electrician.\"\n\nThe eerie black and white image shows two women from different generations -- the older woman appearing to hang on to the younger woman from behind.\n\nOrganizers said they were made aware of some AI involvement, but said there had been \"deliberate\" attempts to mislead them.\n\nEldagsen said he hoped his actions would open up the conversation around the issue and lead to \"separate competitions for AI-generated images.\"\n\nEldagsen said in a statement shared on his website that he had been a \"cheeky monkey\" in a bid to open up the conversation around artificially generated images.\n\n\"Thank you for selecting my image and making this a historic moment, as it is the first AI generated image to win in a prestigous (sic) international PHOTOGRAPHY competition. How many of you knew or suspected that it was AI generated? Something about this doesn't feel right, does it?\"\n\nHe continued: \"AI images and photography should not compete with eachother in an award like this. They are different entities. AI is not photography. Therefore I will not accept the award.\"\n\nHe said he applied \"as a cheeky monkey\" to find out if the competitions \"are prepared for AI images to enter. They are not.\"\n\n'Not about winning'\n\nEldagsen told CNN Tuesday: \"It shows that at the moment the photographic world has been taken by surprise after this development that subtly you can create images that look like photography but you don't need to have the skills and expertise of photographers.\"\n\nHe said that AI had left many photographers feeling \"threatened and afraid that they are going to lose their jobs which will happen.\"\n\nEldagsen said his intention was not to create trouble, but to open up an important conversation.\n\n\"It was not about winning anything,\" he said. \"I was just making a test to see if they were aware -- like a hacker who hacks a system not to exploit it, but to see if there are weaknesses.\"\n\nIn further statements on his website, he said he had informed the organizers of AI involvement.\n\nOrganizers said that 2023 had seen the highest number of entries in the awards' 16-year history. More than 415,000 images were entered across this year's competitions, with more than 180,000 of them eligible for the professional categories.\n\nThree finalists, as well as five to seven shortlisted photographers, were chosen in each category. The selected images were shot by photographers from more than 30 countries in locations ranging from an abandoned cement factory in China to a fish market in Somalia.\n\n'Misleading' claims\n\nThe World Photography Organisation, which runs the competition, told CNN in statement Tuesday that, during the competition's exchanges with Eldagsen ahead of announcing him as a category winner on March 14, he had confirmed the \"co-creation\" of this image using AI.\n\n\"The creative category of the open competition welcomes various experimental approaches to image making from cyanotypes and rayographs to cutting-edge digital practices,\" organizers said.\n\n\"As such, following our correspondence with Boris and the warranties he provided, we felt that his entry fulfilled the criteria for this category, and we were supportive of his participation. Additionally, we were looking forward to engaging in a more in-depth discussion on this topic and welcomed Boris' wish for dialogue by preparing questions for a dedicated Q&A with him for our website.\n\n\"As he [Eldagsen] has now decided to decline his award we have suspended our activities with him and in keeping with his wishes have removed him from the competition. Given his actions and subsequent statement noting his deliberate attempts at misleading us, and therefore invalidating the warranties he provided, we no longer feel we are able to engage in a meaningful and constructive dialogue with him.\"\n\nThe statement said organizers recognize \"the importance of this subject and its impact on image-making today.\"\n\n\"While elements of AI practices are relevant in artistic contexts of image-making, the awards always have been and will continue to be a platform for championing the excellence and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium,\" the World Photography Organisation added.\n\nTop image: Boris Eldagsen's AI-generated image titled 'Pseudomnesia: The Electrician' was submitted to the Sony World Photography Awards 2023 and won first prize in the creative open category.",

                    "top_image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/morgan-wallen-2022-billboard-pro-1260.jpg?w=1024",
                    "snippet": "Size matters. And if country albums were real estate, the property would range from tiny houses to mansions, expanded by a host of duplexes and apartment complexes.\n\nMorgan Wallen‘s No. 1 album One Thing at a Time boasts a hefty 36 tracks, while Bailey Zimmerman‘s top 10 Leave the Light On features a more traditional nine. Jason Aldean dropped two sets, Macon and Georgia, that were intended to form a double album, Macon, Georgia. ERNEST stretched his Flower Shops project into the deluxe Two Dozen Roses album. Mitchell Tenpenny and Dustin Lynch have released EPs offering as few as three songs, and Alana Springsteen recently put out a six-song EP, Twenty Something: Messing It Up, that represents the first of three volumes that will fill out as an 18-track album. The options are wide enough that official press releases sometimes avoid distinguishing between albums and EPs, instead referring to a new release as an innocuous “collection.”\n\nNumerous country executives have confessed to confusion over the developments — how many different versions of an album/EP/collection are there? And which product level is a particular artist working? It’s not clear if music buyers, who may only focus on just a handful of individual artists, are as flummoxed.\n\n“If we’re going to be completely honest, they might be a little confused as to ‘OK — is this an album? Is it an EP or LP? Is it a digital single bundle?'” Big Loud senior vp/GM Patch Culbertson says. “But really, they’re not tripping over themselves too much as to what it truly is. It’s just ‘Is this great music that’s being pushed to me from this artist?'”\n\nThat “digital single” reference is behind the range of options. When music was tied to physical formats, vinyl albums could hold only 22-23 minutes of music on one side before the sound quality began to deteriorate. CDs were limited to 79 minutes.\n\nRecord labels were free to issue two- or three-disc projects, but manufacturing the extra disc and/or odd-size packaging incurred an extra cost.\n\nIn the streaming age, those limitations disappeared. The audience was able to pick specific tracks out of a collection for streaming or downloading, and its consumption simultaneously became easier to track. As a result, labels now tailor the size of new album or EP releases to a range of factors, particularly the artists’ recording volume and the demand of the fan base.\n\n“It varies by every single artist in every situation,” says Sony Music Nashville COO Ken Robold. “I’d like to say, ‘Yeah, here’s the formula,’ but there really isn’t one anymore. It boils down to where the artist is with the songs and where they are in their fan development stage.”\n\nFiguring out the right formula for a particular artist is more art than science, even though there’s plenty of data to work with. In the case of Wallen, who landed 35 cuts from his 36-song One Thing on the Hot Country Songs chart dated March 18, all the material was consumed by a ready public. But if a label is too aggressive and releases more songs by an artist than the audience desires, some of that music will likely get overlooked.\n\n“If you’re Morgan Wallen and the world’s on fire, there’ll be a lot of people that listen to it,” says Brantley Gilbert, whose 10-song So Help Me God will become a 15-track project with the April 21 release of a deluxe edition. “But depending on where somebody is in their career, a lot of these cats, if you release a 15-, 20-song album, you may have a few die-hards roll all the way through it, but you end up burning a lot of songs.”\n\nRelated Country Radio Seminar Strikes Optimistic Tone Amid Tech and Auto Unknowns\n\nThose die-hards are the core audience for an artist, and steadily releasing music helps keep them focused, even if a concurrent radio campaign satisfies more passive customers with a lone song from that artist that stays in rotation for over a year.\n\n“People are listening at an alarming rate to a lot of music,” ERNEST says. “Giving them a chunk is like giving them a playlist for a month or two, depending on how long they want to listen.”\n\nFeeding the demand can be accomplished in more incremental ways than when physical product was dominant. In another era, labels typically released entire albums and picked one single to work to radio, hoping to generate sales for the entire project. Now, a lone track can create interest, and there’s no requirement to immediately capitalize with a full album that may not quite connect.\n\n“It’s a song-by-song world now,” says Robold. “You’re just sort of stacking songs on top of one another. That way, an EP, it sort of introduces fans to this artist, not in such a huge dose. But it hopefully just gets more fans to say, ‘OK, I like this artist,’ and continue to feed that fan base and grow it.”\n\nThe projects with 30 tracks or more by Wallen and others are high-profile releases that have definite short-term appeal. Under the old model, they carried long-term risks. When vinyl double albums became a late-’70s/early-’80s fad, two-disc projects by the likes of Willie Nelson and Bruce Springsteen worked like bonus entries in a streak of ongoing successes. On the other hand, double sets by Elton John, The Electric Light Orchestra and Dan Fogelberg were followed by commercial drops one or two albums later, likely signaling that fans had gotten their fill of those particular acts. Thus far, there’s no sign that stuffing 30-plus songs into an album has adversely affected Wallen or others.\n\n“It’s a fair question: Are you kind of super-saturating the market?’ ” Culbertson asks. “Really the amount of data that we have access to, we can tell if that is happening or if there’s kind of a cooling-off effect. Right now, it’s not a concern at all.”\n\nThat may partially be because music fans no longer have to purchase music they don’t like. When buyers had to pay for the entire album, it likely damaged the artist’s brand if the collection failed to meet expectations. Now the buyer/streamer doesn’t end up forking over money for music that doesn’t connect, and the consumer therefore doesn’t necessarily feel burned. But it often takes longer for artists to get a full investment from the audience.\n\n“It’s difficult to break artists, but it always has been,” notes Robold. “When people’s only option was to buy a CD, if you had something working, it was a pretty good sort of level of comfort that people would be spending the 12 bucks to buy that CD. Now it’s literally micro-pennies, and it’s building it song by song. That’s really, really tough, but when artists connect, there’s still nothing like it.”",

They are not,\" German artist Boris Eldagsen said in a statement on his website about Sony's World Photography Awards.\n\n\"We, the photo world, need an open discussion. A discussion about what we want to consider photography and what not. Is the umbrella of photography large enough to invite AI images to enter – or would this be a mistake?\"\n\n\"With my refusal of the award, I hope to speed up this debate.\"\n\nEldagsen was named the winner in the creative open category in a press release on Sony's website dated March 14.\n\nThe organization described his entry, titled \"Pseudomnesia | The Electrician,\" as \"a haunting black-and-white portrait of two women from different generations, reminiscent of the visual language of 1940s family portraits.\"\n\nPseudomnesia is another name for a false memory. In this case, perhaps the title of the work is itself served as a quiet allusion to its creation not by way of traditional photography, but by way of artificial intelligence.\n\nSWPA told BBC News that Eldagsen \"misled them about the extent of AI that would be involved.\" The artist has challenged that statement.\n\n\"AI images and photography should not compete with each other in an award like this. They are different entities. AI is not photography. Therefore I will not accept the award,\" Eldagsen's statement said.\n\n\"They had so many options to use this for good. They used none of them. Instead they refused to answer my questions, the questions of the press, the questions of concerned photographers.\"\n\nTuesday, In an update to his blog post about the controversial entry, Eldagsen published a scathing, open letter to the SWPA/Creo alongside a chronology of events leading up to his declining the organization's prize.\n\nIn the letter, Eldagsen accuses the the organization of ducking press inquiries about his entry until the \"international photo community took up the issue on social media.\"\n\n\"So stop saying 'we were looking forward to engaging in a more in-depth discussion on this topic' – it is wrong,\" Eldagsen wrote, citing a number of interactions with the organization.\n\nEldagsen says he applied for the prize in December and was informed that he had made the short list on January 13. On March 2, he received word that he had won. On March 3, he replied, telling the organization of his artistic focus on the \"creative possibilities of AI generators,\" and suggesting that Sony might take up the topic as a panel discussion.\"\n\n\"Since I don’t want there to be any misunderstandings here, it is important for me to explain in this email the background of the image you have chosen in as much detail as possible,\" the quoted exchange with the organization said in part.\n\n\n\nIn his post, Eldagsen notes that his image and name were removed from the SWPA site. A search of the World Photography Organization's website conducted by TheBlaze yielded zero results for \"Eldagsen\" and zero results for \"pseudomnesia\" Tuesday morning.\n\nLike Blaze News?

                    "snippet": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Having spent the past several months meeting President Joe Biden, raising millions of dollars for his charitable foundation and promoting the benefits of CPR training, Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin can focus now on the next big objective in his life: returning to football.\n\nWearing a red woolen cap and a Bills blue pullover, Hamlin sat at the podium on Tuesday and said his heart — the one that stopped beating some four months ago during a game in Cincinnati — was, as he put it, “still in the game.”\n\n“This was a life-changing event, but it’s not the end of my story,” Hamlin said. “I plan on making a comeback to the NFL.”\n\nAddressing reporters for the first time since going into cardiac arrest and having to be resuscitated on the field, Hamlin reflected on the anxious moments he’s endured, his inner drive to not let fear stand in his way and how he no longer takes a minute of his life for granted.\n\n“The ‘wow’ moment is every day just being able to wake up and just take deep breaths and live a peaceful life, to have a family and people that are around me that love me,” said Hamlin, who has been medically cleared to play and is taking part in the start of the Bills’ voluntary workout program.\n\n“They almost lost me. Like I died on national TV, you know what I mean?” he added. “So that right there is the biggest blessing of it all, for me to still have my people, and my people still have me.”\n\nGeneral manager Brandon Beane announced earlier in the day that Hamlin was medically cleared to return to football after the 25-year-old met with a third and final specialist on Friday. All three agreed Hamlin could resume playing without any fear of setbacks or complications. While the Bills had their head athletic trainer sit in on those meetings, Beane said the team is following the lead of the specialists.\n\n“He’s such a great kid and has such a great family, and it’s exciting to go from a guy who was fighting for his life to now,” Beane said. “His story hasn’t been written. Now it’s about his comeback.”\n\nHamlin said the specialists agreed his heart stopped as a result of commotio cordis, which is a direct blow at a specific point in a heartbeat that causes cardiac arrest.\n\nHis next steps will be no different from any other NFL player in his bid to secure a roster spot. Hamlin will return to the field when the team’s voluntary spring practices begin next month, followed by mandatory practices in June and then training camp in late July.\n\nHis teammates were elated to see him back in the facility working out.\n\n“D-Ham is a special person, a beautiful soul,” fellow safety Micah Hyde said. “I look up to him, especially how he’s bounced back after facing adversity. A little scary. But to see him well and in the building and move around a little bit, it gives you a little energy.”\n\nHamlin’s recovery is personal to many who watched in shock as Hamlin collapsed on the field on a nationally televised “Monday Night Football” game, but moreso for Beane. While the Bills returned home after the game initially was suspended and eventually canceled, Beane spent the first four days at Hamlin’s side, including when he was awakened from a medically induced coma at the University Cincinnati Medical Center.\n\n“It was all about his health, and it’s always going to be about his health,” Beane said. “But to truly, you know, however many months later be talking about he’s fully cleared is pretty remarkable. And I’m excited for him and his family for where they are on his journey.”\n\nHamlin collapsed after making what appeared to be a routine tackle in the first quarter of a Jan. 2 game against the Bengals. His collapse led to an outpouring of support from around the NFL and across North America, with donations made to Hamlin’s charitable organization topping more than $9 million.\n\nThe second-year player from Pittsburgh’s exurb of McKee’s Rock spent nearly 10 days recovering in hospitals in Cincinnati and Buffalo before being released. He eventually began visiting the Bills’ facility and attended the team’s season-ending 27-10 loss to the Bengals in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nHamlin recalled watching football on TV while lying in his hospital bed in Cincinnati when the thought of playing again first entered his mind.\n\n“Just watching teams play, watching other safeties play, that’s where I saw and felt my love for the game,” he said. “That’s where I was just like, ‘I don’t want to be done yet.’”\n\nHamlin said specialists advised him that returning to football could have mental health benefits, which include enjoying the camaraderie of being among teammates.\n\n“I’m just taking it one day at a time. That’s where I’m at in this process. Any time I try to think too forward, it gets cloudy,” he said. “I’ve got a long journey to go, but I’m committed to it each day.”\n\nHamlin has since made numerous appearances around the country, including meeting with Biden last month.\n\nBiden posted a tweet on the visit that read: “Hamlin’s courage, resilience, and spirit inspired the American people. And what’s more: he turned recovery into action — and our country is better for it.”\n\nHamlin’s visit to Washington came as part of the player’s desire to back a bill that would increase access to defibrillators in public and private elementary and secondary schools.\n\nDuring the Super Bowl festivities in Arizona in February, he received the NFLPA’s Alan Page Community Award. He also took part in a pregame ceremony in which the NFL honored the Bills’ and Bengals’ training and medical staffs and first responders who treated him.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

After receiving CPR and requiring a defibrillator on the field, Hamlin was transported to a hospital and spent seven days in intensive care. He was then transferred to a Buffalo hospital for two days before being discharged.\n\nHe has since been working on his rehabilitation process with the ultimate goal of returning to football.\n\n\"Eventually. That's always the goal. Like I said, as a competitor, you know, I'm trying to do things to keep advancing my situation,\" Hamlin said on a Fox interview prior to the Super Bowl. \"But I'm allowing that to be in God's hands. I'm just thankful he gave me a second chance.\"\n\nHamlin, a 2021 sixth-round pick, emerged as a fixture in the Bills secondary last season. The Pitt product racked up 91 tackles and 1.5 sacks while starting 13 games.\n\nIt's unclear if Hamlin will be able to perform at the same high level, and there is undoubtedly work to be done for him to get back in football condition.

The scene of the 25-year-old receiving CPR after making a tackle was stunning, leading fans to make \"Pray for Damar\" a trending phrase.\n\nHis clearance status is \"just like anyone else who was coming back from an injury,\" Beane said. \"He's in a great headspace to come back and make his return.\"\n\nPer GM Brandon Beane, Damar Hamlin has been cleared to resume full football activities.@HamlinIsland is in Buffalo and in a great headspace. ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/wa2ZfGm8mX — Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) April 18, 2023\n\nHamlin talks his return and what caused his collapse\n\nHamlin later confirmed he is working to play football again when speaking with reporters on Tuesday. \"This event was life changing, but it's not the end of my story. I'm here to announce that I plan on making a comeback to the NFL,\" he said.\n\nHe spoke about his diagnosis of Commotio Cordis, a rare medical condition that can happen after a sudden impact to the chest. Hamlin made contact during a narrow window in the heart rhythm that disrupted his heartbeat and caused sudden cardiac arrest.\n\nCommotio Cordis is the \"leading cause of death in youth athletes across all sports, so that's something definitely something I'll be taking a step in, to make a change,\" Hamlin said.\n\nAlready taking action, he met with President Joe Biden at the White House in March. There, he spoke in support of legislation calling for increased access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in schools.\n\n“This is not the end of my story. I plan to make a comeback to the NFL.” 🫶 pic.twitter.com/jlAMdErKWk — Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) April 18, 2023\n\nA remarkable journey back to the field\n\nHamlin's return to the field is the latest \"remarkable development\" in a recovery that seemed to shock even his treatment team at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. After collapsing on a Monday, he was found to be \"neurologically intact\" and responsive just two days later, though he remained in critical condition.\n\nBuffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin is back on the field. (Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nQuarterback Josh Allen reflected on his teammate's medical emergency in an emotional news conference with reporters that week. When asked if the team was ready to return to the field, he and head coach Sean McDermott agreed. \"We want to go out there and play for 3. It'll be a huge driving force,” Allen said of Hamlin. McDermott added that the team was offered counseling and other resources because “mental health is real.”\n\nBy Friday, Hamlin's breathing tube was removed and he was able to FaceTime his teammates as they prepared to face the New England Patriots before the playoffs.\n\nExactly a week after being resuscitated on the field, he was discharged from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and transferred to a hospital in Buffalo.\n\nTwo days later, the team announced Hamlin was cleared to continue his rehab at home and with the Bills.\n\nIn the months between his being discharged from the hospital and now being cleared for full activity, Hamlin saw an outpouring of support in the form of skyrocketing jersey sales, tributes from the league and millions of dollars donated to his charity.\n\nThe Bills confirmed that Hamlin would work out with the team in Buffalo with a social media post on Tuesday, writing \"Glad to have you back, 3.\"",

                    "snippet": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — Having spent the past several months meeting President Joe Biden, raising millions of dollars for his charitable foundation and promoting the benefits of CPR training, Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin can focus now on the next big objective in his life: returning to football.\n\nWearing a red woolen cap and a Bills blue pullover, Hamlin sat at the podium on Tuesday and said his heart — the one that stopped beating some four months ago during a game in Cincinnati — was, as he put it, “still in the game.”\n\n“This was a life-changing event, but it’s not the end of my story,” Hamlin said. “I plan on making a comeback to the NFL.”\n\nAddressing reporters for the first time since going into cardiac arrest and having to be resuscitated on the field, Hamlin reflected on the anxious moments he’s endured, his inner drive to not let fear stand in his way and how he no longer takes a minute of his life for granted.\n\n“The ‘wow’ moment is every day just being able to wake up and just take deep breaths and live a peaceful life, to have a family and people that are around me that love me,” said Hamlin, who has been medically cleared to play and is taking part in the start of the Bills‘ voluntary workout program.\n\n“They almost lost me. Like I died on national TV, you know what I mean?” he added. “So that right there is the biggest blessing of it all, for me to still have my people, and my people still have me.”\n\nGeneral manager Brandon Beane announced earlier in the day that Hamlin was medically cleared to return to football after the 25-year-old met with a third and final specialist on Friday. All three agreed Hamlin could resume playing without any fear of setbacks or complications. While the Bills had their head athletic trainer sit in on those meetings, Beane said the team is following the lead of the specialists.\n\n“He’s such a great kid and has such a great family, and it’s exciting to go from a guy who was fighting for his life to now,” Beane said. “His story hasn’t been written. Now it’s about his comeback.”\n\nHamlin said the specialists agreed his heart stopped as a result of commotio cordis, which is a direct blow at a specific point in a heartbeat that causes cardiac arrest.\n\nHis next steps will be no different from any other NFL player in his bid to secure a roster spot. Hamlin will return to the field when the team’s voluntary spring practices begin next month, followed by mandatory practices in June and then training camp in late July.\n\nHis teammates were elated to see him back in the facility working out.\n\n“D-Ham is a special person, a beautiful soul,” fellow safety Micah Hyde said. “I look up to him, especially how he’s bounced back after facing adversity. A little scary. But to see him well and in the building and move around a little bit, it gives you a little energy.”\n\nHamlin’s recovery is personal to many who watched in shock as Hamlin collapsed on the field on a nationally televised “Monday Night Football” game, but moreso for Beane. While the Bills returned home after the game initially was suspended and eventually canceled, Beane spent the first four days at Hamlin’s side, including when he was awakened from a medically induced coma at the University Cincinnati Medical Center.\n\n“It was all about his health, and it’s always going to be about his health,” Beane said. “But to truly, you know, however many months later be talking about he’s fully cleared is pretty remarkable. And I’m excited for him and his family for where they are on his journey.”\n\nHamlin collapsed after making what appeared to be a routine tackle in the first quarter of a Jan. 2 game against the Bengals. His collapse led to an outpouring of support from around the NFL and across North America, with donations made to Hamlin’s charitable organization topping more than $9 million.\n\nThe second-year player from Pittsburgh’s exurb of McKee’s Rock spent nearly 10 days recovering in hospitals in Cincinnati and Buffalo before being released. He eventually began visiting the Bills’ facility and attended the team’s season-ending 27-10 loss to the Bengals in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nHamlin recalled watching football on TV while lying in his hospital bed in Cincinnati when the thought of playing again first entered his mind.\n\n“Just watching teams play, watching other safeties play, that’s where I saw and felt my love for the game,” he said. “That’s where I was just like, ‘I don’t want to be done yet.’”\n\nHamlin said specialists advised him that returning to football could have mental health benefits, which include enjoying the camaraderie of being among teammates.\n\n“I’m just taking it one day at a time. That’s where I’m at in this process. Any time I try to think too forward, it gets cloudy,” he said. “I’ve got a long journey to go, but I’m committed to it each day.”\n\nHamlin has since made numerous appearances around the country, including meeting with Biden last month.\n\nBiden posted a tweet on the visit that read: “Hamlin’s courage, resilience, and spirit inspired the American people. And what’s more: he turned recovery into action — and our country is better for it.”\n\nHamlin’s visit to Washington came as part of the player’s desire to back a bill that would increase access to defibrillators in public and private elementary and secondary schools.\n\nDuring the Super Bowl festivities in Arizona in February, he received the NFLPA’s Alan Page Community Award. He also took part in a pregame ceremony in which the NFL honored the Bills’ and Bengals’ training and medical staffs and first responders who treated him.",

He wrote on Instagram on Tuesday: 'Hard times don't last. My story is my testimony. 3 is back! #almosthealed.'\n\n'This event was life changing, but it's not the end of my story, so I'm here to announce that I plan on making a comeback to the NFL,' Hamlin said Tuesday.\n\nPer GM Brandon Beane, Damar Hamlin has been cleared to resume full football activities.@HamlinIsland is in Buffalo and in a great headspace. ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/wa2ZfGm8mX — Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) April 18, 2023\n\nBuffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin has been cleared to return to football, according to the team\n\nPlayers react as Hamlin is taken off the field and into an ambulance before emergency surgery\n\n'My heart is still in it,' Hamlin continued. 'My heart is still in the game. I love the game. It's something I want to prove to myself, not nobody else. I just want to show people that fear is a choice, that you can keep going in something without having the answers and without knowing what's at the end of the tunnel. You might feel anxious. You might feel any type of way, you know, but you just keep putting that right foot in front of the left one and you keep going.'\n\nThe Bills begin off-season organized team activities (OTAs) on May 22, when Hamlin could be in uniform for the first time since his cardiac arrest. The team will hold minicamp June 13 through 15. The NFL's 2023 preseason games begin on August 3 with the season openers scheduled for September 7. In the meantime, Hamlin is working out at the Bills' facility in Orchard Park, New York.\n\n'We're super excited for Damar,' Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Tuesday. 'He's moving forward one step at a time here. He's been cleared from a physical standpoint. We'll provide all the mental help we can from a mind, body and spirit standpoint. Just happy for him that he's been able to check some of those boxes to this point, and we're moving forward, but taking it one day at a time.'\n\n'D-Ham is a special person, a beautiful soul,' Bills safety Micah Hyde said.

'So much to be thankful for.'\n\nThat's certainly an understatement.\n\nHamlin needed to be resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati before being rushed to a local hospital for emergency surgery on January 2, and has since undergone months of rehabilitation as his NFL future remains up in the air.\n\nHe has since made numerous appearances around the country, including during the Super Bowl festivities in Arizona, where he received the NFLPA's Alan Page Community Award. He also took part in a pregame ceremony in which the NFL honored the Bills and Bengals training and medical staffs and first responders who treated the Pittsburgh native.\n\nIn February, it was reported that Hamlin had a few more visits to doctors before determining whether he can pursue his goal of returning to the league.\n\nHamlin tweeted that he has 'so much to be thankful for' after his near-death experience\n\nIn providing the update at the NFL combine in Indianapolis on February 28, Beane said Hamlin's 'end game' is to resume playing so long as he receives the necessary medical clearance.\n\n'If we're able to get full clearance and he feels he's ready to do it, that's another big smile of a story,' Beane said at the time. 'Not only that he's just got his life back, but that he'd have his football career back. I would love to give the storybook ending that he's definitely going to play, but we just don't know that yet. But if he does, we'll be very happy for him.'\n\nIn February, Beane said 'all is well' with Hamlin's test results after visiting numerous specialists around the country.\n\nHamlin has enjoyed what doctors are calling a remarkable recovery since collapsing on the field after making what appeared to be a routine tackle in the first quarter of a game against the Bengals which was suspended and eventually canceled.\n\nThe second-year player from Pittsburgh's exurb of McKee's Rock spent nearly 10 days recovering in hospitals in both Cincinnati and Buffalo before being released.

Hamlin is \"cleared to resume full activities just like anyone else who is coming back from an injury,\" Beane stated.\n\nBeane explained that Hamlin remains in touch with medical specialists, who have all approved Hamlin for a full return to play. \"They're all in agreement,\" Beane said. \"...They're all in lockstep\" that Hamlin should be able to play without further restrictions.\n\n\"He's fully cleared, he's here, and he's ... in a great headspace to come back and make his return,\" Beane concluded.\n\nPer GM Brandon Beane, Damar Hamlin has been cleared to resume full football activities.@HamlinIsland is in Buffalo and in a great headspace. ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/wa2ZfGm8mX\n\n— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) April 18, 2023\n\n\"Glad to have you back, 3,\" the team tweeted on Tuesday in support of Hamlin, who wears number 3.\n\nHamlin's full clearance seems like a fitting conclusion to a recovery that some have described as \"miraculous.\" On January 2, Hamlin appeared to make a routine tackle on Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins. However, shortly after the tackle, Hamlin collapsed to the ground, prompting medical personnel to perform life-saving measures on the field in Paycor Stadium. Reports indicate that Hamlin had to be resuscitated twice that night, once on the field and once later at the hospital. The game was ultimately canceled.\n\n\n\nAt just 24 years old, Hamlin had gone into cardiac arrest and was initially listed in critical condition. However, within days, he was communicating with teammates via FaceTime, and before the end of the month, Hamlin had already released a video which showed him in good health and in good spirits.\n\nHamlin's health scare quickly took on a religious component. The day after Hamlin's collapse, ESPN host Dan Orlovsky spontaneously led fellow \"NFL Live\" panelists in prayer for Hamlin's recovery, and players from around the league soon began wearing warm-up shirts that read, \"Pray for Damar.\" Bills quarterback Josh Allen claimed that the team experienced a \"spiritual awakening\" soon after the incident, and after his release from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Hamlin made several public appearances praising God for his recovery and for those who have assisted him along the way.\n\n\"What happened to me on Monday Night Football, I feel, is a direct example of God using me as a vessel to share my passion and my love directly from my heart with the entire world,\" he said.\n\nHamlin, Allen, and the rest of the Bills likely have high expectations for themselves next year after falling short again last season. On January 21, less than three weeks after Hamlin's collapse, the Bills had their Super Bowl aspirations thwarted for the second year in a row when they lost to the Bengals in the divisional round of the playoffs. NFL schedules for the 2023-24 season have not yet been released, but the Bills will likely begin their season in the first or second week of September.\n\nLike Blaze News?

                    "snippet": "The NFL's Damar Hamlin nearly died on the field in January when his heart stopped after a hit. In news that would have seemed impossible at the time, the Buffalo Bills said Tuesday that Hamlin has been medically cleared to play football again, reports Yahoo Sports. \"He is fully cleared,\" GM Brandon Beane told reporters Tuesday, per ESPN. \"He's here ... and he's in a great headspace to make his return.\" Beane said three specialists have unanimously agreed that Hamlin isn't at risk to suit up again.\n\nThe 25-year-old Hamlin received lifesaving CPR on the field, and he was back home from the hospital to recuperate within 10 days. However, it had been unclear until Tuesday whether he would be able to play football again. Hamlin has been using his celebrity to lobby for more automated external defibrillators, or AEDs, to be made available to schools, along with related training, notes ESPN. A New York Times reporter who covered Hamlin's close call has wondered why AEDs aren't more common in households. At the moment, one reason for that is price: They typically run more than $1,000.

                    "snippet": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin is cleared to resume playing and is attending the team’s voluntary workout program, the latest and biggest steps in his remarkable recovery some four months after going into cardiac arrest and having to be resuscitated on the field during a game at Cincinnati.\n\n“He’s fully cleared. He’s here and he is of the mindset. He’s in a great headspace to come back and make his return,” general manager Brandon Beane said Tuesday.\n\nBeane said the clearance came after Hamlin met with a third and final specialist on Friday, with all three being in agreement that Hamlin can resume playing without any fear of setbacks or complications. While the Bills had their head athletic trainer sit in on Hamlin’s meetings with specialists, Beane said the team is following the lead of the specialists.\n\n“He’s such a great kid and has such a great family, and it’s exciting to go from a guy who was fighting for his life to now,” Beane said. “His story hasn’t been written. Now it’s about his comeback.”\n\nHamlin’s recovery is personal to many who watched in shock as Hamlin collapsed on the field on a nationally televised “Monday Night Football” game, but moreso for Beane. While the Bills returned home after the game initially was suspended and eventually canceled, Beane spent the first four days at Hamlin’s side, including when he was awakened from a medically induced coma at the University Cincinnati Medical Center.\n\n“It was all about his health, and it’s always going to be about his health,” Beane said. “But to truly, you know, however many months later be talking about he’s fully cleared is pretty remarkable. And I’m excited for him and his family where for where they are on his journey.”\n\nHamlin collapsed after making what appeared to be a routine tackle in the first quarter of a Jan. 2 game against the Bengals. His collapse led to an outporing of support from around the NFL and across North America, with donations made to Hamlin’s charitable organization topping more than $9 million.\n\nThe second-year player from Pittsburgh’s exurb of McKee’s Rock spent nearly 10 days recovering in hospitals in Cincinnati and Buffalo before being released. He eventually began visiting the Bills’ facility and attended the team’s season-ending 27-10 loss to Cincinnati in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nHamlin has since made numerous appearances around the country, including meeting with President Joe Biden last month. During the Super Bowl festivities in Arizona in February, he received the NFLPA’s Alan Page Community Award. He also took part in a pregame ceremony in which the NFL honored the Bills’ and Bengals’ training and medical staffs and first responders who treated the 24-year-old.\n\n",

                    "snippet": "Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nBuffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin said Tuesday he intends to resume his NFL career after receiving clearance from medical experts. “Over these last few months, I’ve been on a journey, and I’ve seen some of the top professionals across the country,” Hamlin said during a news conference at the Bills’ training facility in Orchard Park, N.Y. “And their answers to me were pretty much all the same. … This event was life-changing, but it’s not the end of my story. So I’m here to announce that I plan on making a comeback to the NFL.”\n\nHamlin, 25, made his announcement less than four months after he suffered cardiac arrest on the field during a Jan. 2 game in Cincinnati and was resuscitated by medical personnel. He said doctors had diagnosed that his cardiac arrest was caused by commotio cordis, a rare condition in which an impact to the chest results in an abnormal heart rhythm.\n\n“My heart is still in the game,” Hamlin said. “I love the game. It’s something I want to prove to myself, not nobody else. I just want to show people that fear is a choice, that you can keep going in something without having the answers and without knowing what’s at the end of the tunnel. You might feel anxious … but you just keep putting that right foot in front of the left one and you keep going.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: “Not to sound cliche, man, but the ‘wow’ moment is every day just being able to wake up and just take deep breaths and live a peaceful life, to have a family, to have people around me that love me and that care about me, and for those people to still have me in their lives. They almost lost me. I died on national TV in front of the whole world.”\n\nWe’re live with Damar Hamlin as he meets with the media at One Bills Drive.#GoBills | #BillsMafia https://t.co/eVanoLOwqZ — Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) April 18, 2023\n\nThe Bills announced Tuesday that Hamlin had been cleared to “resume full activities.” He is participating in the their offseason workouts, which have not yet included on-field drills.\n\n“We’re super excited for Damar,” Bills Coach Sean McDermott said. “He’s moving forward one step at a time here. He’s been cleared from a physical standpoint, and we’ll provide all the mental help we can from a mind, body and spirit standpoint.”\n\nAfter Hamlin was resuscitated and taken by ambulance to University of Cincinnati Medical Center, he made what his doctors called a remarkable recovery. He later was transferred to a Buffalo-area hospital and then released to continue his recovery at home and under the Bills’ supervision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“He saw a couple of specialists here in Buffalo,” Bills General Manager Brandon Beane said Tuesday. “And then since then, he’s seen three additional specialists, most recently on Friday. And they’re all in agreement. It’s not two to one or three to one or anything like that.”\n\nPer GM Brandon Beane, Damar Hamlin has been cleared to resume full football activities.@HamlinIsland is in Buffalo and in a great headspace. ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/wa2ZfGm8mX — Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) April 18, 2023\n\nHamlin said the “hardest hurdle” he will face in playing football again will be dealing with the “roller coaster of emotions” associated with his return. He said he believes he has the proper support around him. McDermott said the Bills are “just thankful that he’s in the spot that he’s in today.”\n\n“We’re excited for him,” Ira Turner, one of Hamlin’s representatives, said in a phone interview Tuesday. “This has been a dream of his since he’s been a kid.”\n\nSaid Bills quarterback Josh Allen: “I haven’t been able to give him a big old hug yet. But it’s been good to see him in the building. Right when this thing happened, his mind-set from the very start was, ‘I’m going to play again.’ And you’re never going to doubt a guy like that, who’s had a lot of adversity in his life and he’s continued to find ways.”\n\nHamlin previously expressed interest in resuming his NFL career. “Yeah, I think so,” he told President Biden during a visit to the White House last month when asked whether he thought he would be able to play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAllen Sills, the NFL’s chief medical officer, told The Washington Post during a videoconference in February that the Bills and their medical staff were arranging for Hamlin to receive additional opinions from medical experts to assist him in making a decision about resuming his football career. The process was “not a league-led function,” Sills said then. Hamlin and his advisers would make the decision without further clearance required by the NFL and the NFL Players Association, Sills added.\n\nDamar Hamlin is working out with the team today in Buffalo.\n\n\n\nGlad to have you back, 3. 🫶 pic.twitter.com/n80HheSIaG — Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) April 18, 2023\n\n“It’s his decision,” Sills said. “And he is the person that will need to drive that decision, and then we’ll all line up and support that. … I think right now the focus is on his recovery and his continued improvement. And then there will be another day and time to discuss all that. But it will be strictly led by him and those that are close to him.”\n\nThom Mayer, the NFLPA’s medical director, said on SiriusXM Doctor Radio in February, “I guarantee you … that Damar Hamlin will play professional football again.”\n\nHamlin was in Phoenix for Super Bowl-related activities. He appeared at the NFLPA’s news conference and received the union’s award, named for former NFL great Alan Page, for community service. Hamlin received a standing ovation when he appeared onstage that week at the NFL Honors awards show.\n\n“My vision was about playing in the NFL and being the best player that I could be,” Hamlin said that night. “But God’s plan was to have a purpose greater than any game in this world. … I have a long journey ahead, a journey full of unknowns and a journey full of milestones. But it’s a lot easier to face your fears when you know your purpose.”\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

                    "snippet": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Just over 3½ months after commotio cordis caused Damar Hamlin to collapse on a football field in Cincinnati, Hamlin sat in the Buffalo Bills' facility and officially announced his plans on making a comeback to the NFL after being fully cleared to return to playing football.\n\nBut the remarkable achievement of going from suffering cardiac arrest on national TV to returning to workouts with his teammates is just the next chapter in Hamlin's journey.\n\n\"This event was life changing, but it's not the end of my story,\" Hamlin said.\n\nHamlin shared Tuesday -- during his first news conference since the events on Jan. 2 during the first quarter of a regular-season \"Monday Night Football\" game against the Cincinnati Bengals -- that doctors concluded that Hamlin suffered a specific type of cardiac arrest, commotio cordis, \"an extremely rare consequence of blunt force trauma to the heart that happens at exactly the wrong time in the heart rhythm, causing the heart to stop beating effectively,\" per the American Heart Association. Collapsing occurs within a few seconds.\n\nFor the 25-year-old safety, who has been cleared by multiple specialists, returning to the field is something that he wants to do for himself.\n\n\"My heart is still in the game. I love the game. It is something I want to prove to myself, not nobody else,\" Hamlin said. \"I just wanna show people that that fear is a choice that you can keep going in something without having the answers and without knowing what's at the end of the tunnel. Or you might feel anxious, you might feel any type of way, but you just keep putting that right foot in front of the left one, and you keep going. I want to stand for that.\"\n\nCommotio cordis is a \"diagnosis of exclusion,\" Dr. William Knight IV, professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Director of the Emergency Medicine MLP Program and part of Hamlin's care team, said in January. That means that more common, deadly or fixable conditions have to first be ruled out before commotio cordis is the diagnosis.\n\nThere are no risk factors for commotio cordis, per the American Heart Association, which also cites out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest as the leading cause of death for student athletes. Lowering numbers like that, Hamlin said, is something he \"personally will be taking a step in to make a change.\"\n\nHamlin saw his last of three heart specialists, who were located in various parts of the country, Friday and is in attendance and participating at voluntary workouts with the Bills this week. Bills head athletic trainer Nate Breske also accompanied Hamlin on those trips.\n\nThat final specialist went so far as to tell Hamlin that he felt returning to playing would be good for his mental health.\n\n\"Being around my teammates, the camaraderie of the sport of football, you know, that's what makes this sport the best in the world, is the brotherhood that it creates, the unity that it creates between all people of all aspects of life and just different journeys, it brings them together for one common goal,\" Hamlin said. \"And I feel like that's a direct correlation of what happened to me that night, you know, just bringing people together in prayer, love, but that's what this sport does as well, so my heart is in it completely and it takes a lot to be great in this game, and I got a long way to go. I got a long journey to go, but I'm committed to it each day, day in, day out.\"\n\nThe steps ahead for Hamlin includes taking things one day at a time and the mental steps of gradually upgrading to playing football. The mental journey and rollercoaster of emotions is the \"hardest hurdle,\" per Hamlin, but he noted how he has the right people in his corner, including those in the Bills' facility.\n\nBills general manager Brandon Beane said that all of the specialists were in agreement on Hamlin's case and on his being able to fully return to playing football.\n\n\"This event was life changing, but it's not the end of my story,\" Damar Hamlin said as he attempts to return to the field after suffering cardiac arrest. John Wawrow/AP\n\n\"When he left Cincinnati, he came here, it was Buffalo General [Medical Center],\" Beane said. \"He saw a couple of specialists here in Buffalo, and then, since then, he's seen three additional specialists, most recently on Friday, and they're all in agreement. It's not 2-1 or 3-1 or anything like that. They're all in lockstep of what this was and that he's cleared, resumed full activities just like anyone else who was coming back from an injury or whatever.\"\n\nThe Bills began their voluntary offseason program Monday. The team shared a video of the team's workouts which included Hamlin going through a variety of exercises alongside his defensive teammates.\n\nBills coach Sean McDermott and Beane emphasized that the team will continue to support Hamlin from a mental health perspective.\n\n\"He's moving forward one step at a time here,\" McDermott said. \"He's been cleared from a physical standpoint, and we'll provide all the mental help we can from a mind, body and spirit standpoint.\"\n\nLast month, Hamlin spent time in Washington, D.C., to help promote the bipartisan legislation Access to AEDs, which would increase the availability of automated external defibrillators -- and related training -- on school campuses. He also met with President Joe Biden at the White House.\n\nThe NFL has launched the Smart Heart Sports Coalition, a collaboration with several groups to advocate for policies in all 50 states aimed at preventing fatal outcomes from sudden cardiac arrest among high school athletes. The goal of the coalition is to pass legislation at the state level and implement these policies within the next three years, and the group sent letters to governors of 43 states where it believes additional policies are needed.\n\nHamlin has had a busy couple of months, including receiving the NFLPA's highest honor, the Alan Page Community Award, for his work helping others. His Chasing M's Foundation raised more than $9 million in the days after he went to the hospital, with the money largely going through GoFundMe for a toy drive that had an initial goal of $2,500. Giving back to the youth is a priority for Hamlin, who noted how he has been beating statistics his whole life coming from McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, playing and graduating from Pitt and building a career in the NFL, while helping his community along the way.\n\nDespite all that has come, Hamlin said \"wow\" moments for him are being able to wake up every day and be around his family, \"the biggest blessing of it all is for me to still have my people and my people still to have me.\"\n\n\"It's just good when great things happen to great people,\" Bills pass-rusher Von Miller said. \"With everything that has happened, he's took full advantage of it, and he's used the platform that he's had from the exposure from everything that has happened, and he's used that for good. And not just one time but multiple times. He's been to the White House. He's talking to kids like, he has taken full advantage of the opportunity that God has given him, and to see him get cleared to play football again, because I know all of that stuff, even though it's great, but it really comes, for him, and I'm just speaking for him, it really comes secondary on going out there and living out your childhood dream.\"\n\nHamlin was also recognized alongside the medical and athletic training staff of the Bills and Bengals and some of the staff from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center at the NFL Honors and on the field before Super Bowl LVII.\n\n\"It's exciting to go from a guy who was fighting for his life to who is now, his story hasn't been written,\" said Beane, who spent multiple days in the hospital with Hamlin and his family. \"Now it's about the comeback, and so, to see that he, it was all about his health and it's still, it's always going to be about his health, but to truly, however many months later, be talking about he's been fully cleared is pretty remarkable.

                    "snippet": "Damar Hamlin has returned to working out with the Buffalo Bills just 106 days after his cardiac arrest on national TV, as the safety underwent strength and conditioning training following a unanimous decision for him 'to resume football activities'.\n\nThe 25-year-old was all smiles on Tuesday, per footage from the Bills' official Twitter account, as he was seen going through some light footwork exercises alongside some of his teammates before bouncing a medicine ball off the synthetic field of Buffalo's ADPRO Sports Training Center.\n\nHamlin, who wore a short-sleeve Bills blue training jacket, seemed to be having fun in what was his first involvement with the team in four months.\n\nAt one point, he even pulled his tongue out in front of several Bills trainers, who were visibly closely monitoring the 2021 sixth-round draft pick.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Hamlin announced his intention to return to league action while also revealing the cause of his on-field collapse: commotio cordis.\n\nDamar Hamlin, 25, was all smiles upon his return to Bills training for first time in four months\n\nThe safety underwent conditioning training with a ball on Tuesday at Buffalo's training facility\n\n'This was a life-changing event, but it's not the end of my story,' Hamlin said. 'I plan on making a comeback to the NFL.'\n\nAddressing reporters for the first time since his heart stopped beating and having to be resuscitated at Paycor Stadium - home of the Bengals - back in January, Hamlin reflected on the anxious moments he's endured, his inner drive to not let fear stand in his way and how he no longer takes a minute of his life for granted.\n\n'The ''wow'' moment is every day just being able to wake up and just take deep breaths and live a peaceful life, to have a family and people that are around me that love me,' the former Pittsburgh man said.\n\n'They almost lost me. Like I died on national TV, you know what I mean?' he added. 'So that right there is the biggest blessing of it all, for me to still have my people, and my people still have me.'\n\nBills general manager Brandon Beane announced earlier on Tuesday that Hamlin was medically cleared to return to playing football after a third and final consultation with a specialist on Friday.\n\nAll three agreed Hamlin could resume playing without any fear of setbacks or complications. While the Bills had their head athletic trainer sit in on those meetings, Beane said the team is following the lead of the specialists.\n\n'He's such a great kid and has such a great family, and it's exciting to go from a guy who was fighting for his life to now,' Beane said. 'His story hasn't been written. Now it's about his comeback.'\n\nHamlin said the specialists agreed his heart stopped as a result of commotio cordis, which is a direct blow at a specific point in a heartbeat that causes cardiac arrest.\n\nHamlin's return to training was his first involvement with the team since his January 2 collapse\n\nWorking out along with Bills teammates, Hamlin was closely monitored by several trainers\n\nHamlin revealed his heart stopped as a result of commotio cordis, which is a direct blow at a specific point in a heartbeat that causes cardiac arrest\n\nHis next steps will be no different from any other NFL player in his bid to secure a roster spot.\n\nHamlin will return to the field when the team's voluntary spring practices begin next month, followed by mandatory practices in June and then training camp in late July.\n\nHis teammates were elated to see him back in the facility working out.\n\n'D-Ham is a special person, a beautiful soul,' fellow safety Micah Hyde said.\n\n'I look up to him, especially how he's bounced back after facing adversity. A little scary. But to see him well and in the building and move around a little bit, it gives you a little energy.'",

                    "snippet": "Damar Hamlin is returning to the NFL.\n\nFour months after suffering cardiac arrest during a game, the Buffalo Bills safety announced he will take the football field once more. And while sharing the news during an April 18 press conference, he also revealed the cause behind the collapse that saw him rushed to a hospital: commotio cordis.\n\n\"It's a direct blow at a specific point in your heartbeat that causes cardiac arrest, and five-to-seven seconds later, you fall out,\" Hamlin explained, per the NFL. \"That's pretty much what everyone's seen Jan. 2 of this year. Commotio cordis is the leading cause of death in youth athletes across all sports. So that's something that I personally will be taking a step in to make a change.\"\n\nAs for his NFL comeback, Hamlin noted he wants to inspire others to push through setbacks, adding, \"I just want to show people that fear is a choice.\"\n\nBuffalo Bills and NFL Honor Damar Hamlin Amid Hospitalization\n\n\"You can keep going in something without having the answers and without knowing what's at the end of the tunnel,\" the 25-year-old continued. \"Or you might feel anxious, you might feel any type of way, but you keep putting that right foot in front of the left one and you keep going. I want to stand for that.\"\n\nHe also reflected on what he's most grateful for—the chance to still see his loved ones everyday.\n\n\"I died on national TV in front of the whole world,\" Hamlin shared. \"So, I see it from all perspectives. For them to still have me around, and for me to still have them, it goes both ways. And I lost a bunch of people in my life, and I know a bunch of people who have lost people in their lives, and I know that feeling. So that right there is just the biggest blessing of it all. For me to still have my people, and for my people to still have me.\"\n\nMegan Briggs/Getty Images\n\nBack in January, Hamlin suddenly fell during a game against the Cincinnati Bengals after tackling receiver Tee Higgins, resulting in Hamlin receiving more than 10 minutes of CPR on the field. Immediately following his collapse, the athlete received more than 10 minutes of CPR on the field before being transported to the hospital where he was in critical condition.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter spending time in the ICU at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Hamlin was transported to New York's Buffalo General Hospital before being discharged to continue his recovery at home on Jan. 11.\n\nThe following month, Hamlin paid tribute to thanked the first responders who saved his life.\n\n\"Every day I am amazed that my experiences could encourage so many others across the country and even across the world,\" Hamlin said onstage at the 2023 NFL Honors in February. \"Encourage to pray, encourage to spread love, and encourage to keep fighting no matter the circumstances. Sudden cardiac arrest was nothing I would have ever chosen to be a part of my story, but that's because sometimes our own visions are too small even when we think we are seeing the bigger picture.\"\n\nFor the latest breaking news updates, click here to download the E!

Hamlin told Biden, “I think so. … God willing.”\n\nHamlin is now in a position to make that a reality.\n\nIn a Tuesday press conference, Bills General Manager Brandon Beane said that Hamlin is in the building as the club begins its offseason program and has been “fully cleared” after seeing three specialists.\n\n”They’re all in agreement — it’s not two to one or three to one or anything like that — they’re all in lockstep of what this was and that he is cleared to resume full activities just like anyone else that was coming back from an injury,” Beane said. “He’s fully cleared. He’s here. And he is of the mindset — he’s in a great headspace — to come back and make his return.”\n\nHamlin has made remarkable progress since suffering cardiac arrest on the field in Cincinnati in January and this is one more step in a positive direction.\n\nThere is still plenty of time between now and September, but Hamlin being cleared to work out and participate in the offseason program is a testament to all those who worked to save his life.",

After being hospitalized for a full week, the 25-year-old began making strides toward a complete recovery. Now, the team’s general manager Brandon Beane has announced that Hamlin has been given the go-ahead to return to the field.\n\n“He’s fully cleared,” Beane told reporters during a press conference on Tuesday, April 18. “He’s here, and he is of the mindset, he’s in a great headspace to come back and make his return.”\n\nBeane added that Hamlin sought guidance from four separate specialists in Buffalo to make sure his health was where it needed to be before making the decision to return, with his latest appointment last Friday. “They’re all in agreement. It’s not 2-1 or 3-1 or anything like that,” he explained. “They’re all in lockstep of what this was and that he is cleared to resume full activities just like anyone else who was coming back from an injury.”\n\nIn his first interview after the incident, Hamlin described his potential NFL return to Good Morning America as “a tough situation.” He explained: “That’s always the goal, but I’m allowing it to be in God’s hands. It’s a tough situation. They can’t really tell because it’s an up to me thing, I guess. It’s a long road. They just were worried about trying to get me back to normal as much as they can.”\n\nAnd it wasn’t just his physical recovery that he was worried about. “I’m still trying to process all the emotions in the trauma that comes from dealing with a situation like that and not really having people around or no one in my immediate circle who’s dealt with something like that,” Hamlin added.",

The incident - as well as the Buffalo Bills safety’s recovery - hit international headlines while several concerning conspiracies surfaced too.\n\nBack on 3 January, Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed to the field in the first quarter of the regular season clash between the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals. Hamlin - who had just committed a seemingly innocuous tackle on receiver Tee Higgins - had to be revived before he was rushed to the University of Cincinnati hospital.\n\nFollowing the haunting scenes, the match was swiftly suspended as players were visibly shaken and unable to continue. The severity of Hamlin’s condition became clear, with an outpouring of support for the 24-year-old and his family while his charity earned millions in donations.\n\nThankfully, Hamlin remarkably recovered and was fully discharged from hospital in January while he was seen at both NFL Honours and Super Bowl LVII in Arizona. After he was discharged from hospital, Hamlin also attended the Bills’ 27-10 playoff defeat to the Bengals - where a wild conspiracy formed.\n\nREAD MORE: Jalen Hurts sent Instagram DM that led to record-breaking NFL contract",

Hamlin’s medical emergency occurred during the Bills' Monday Night Football game against the Cincinnati Bengals at the start of the year.\n\nHamlin took a hit from Bengals receiver Tee Higgins and suffered a cardiac arrest. Paramedics rushed onto the field to restart his heart using CPR and a defibrillator, before taking him to the University of Cincinnati Hospital for further treatment. In February, Hamlin announced his intentions to return to the NFL, and the 25-year-old has taken a massive step closer to his goal after being fully cleared. Buffalo general manager Brandon Beane issued an update on Tuesday, revealing Hamlin has already been working out ahead of the 2023 NFL season. “He's fully cleared,” Beane said. “He's here, and he is of the mindset, he's in a great headspace to come back and make his return.\" Hamlin has used his near-death experience to raise awareness for CPR training and AED accessibility. “Now that my brothers have closed out a strong winning season, as I continue to make so much progress recovering, I think it's a good time to start sharing some things,” said Hamlin following the incident earlier this year.\n\nDamar Hamlin suffered an on-field cardiac arrest\n\n“I think it was important for me to wait and speak publicly for the first time as it took a long time to process within myself physically, mentally and spiritually, it's been a lot to process. I can't tell you how appreciative I am of all the love, all the support, and everything that's just been coming my way. “What happened to me on Monday Night Football I feel is a direct example of God using me as a vessel to share my passion and my love directly from the heart to the entire world. I'm able to give it back to the kids and communities all across the world who need it most, and that's always been my dream, that's always been what I've stood for and what I'll continue to stand for.\"\n\nBills teammates and NFL rivals were left shook from the early 2023 incident",

Read more\n\nDarren Swift remembers when former Temple wide receiver Jose Barbon began working out at Swift Fit this offseason.\n\nSwift, who is the father of Detroit Lions running back D’Andre Swift, has been training Barbon in preparation for the 2023 NFL draft from April 27-29.\n\n“I remember him going outside and actually throwing up a few times, and [he] rinsed his mouth out,” Swift said. “I thought he was going to quit, but he came right back in. The fortitude to keep going and pressing ahead showed me a lot. It showed me he is willing to do what it takes.”\n\n» READ MORE: The key takeaways from Temple football’s spring game\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarbon underwent resistance training and plyometric exercises that pushed his limits. His determination led to off-season success.\n\nBarbon had a 40-meter dash time of 4.47 seconds and leaped a distance of 10 feet, 8 inches in the broad jump at Temple’s annual pro day last month. Following his performance during the Owls’ event, he was invited to the Philadelphia Eagles’ local pro day on Wednesday.\n\nBarbon caught 72 passes for 918 yards and two touchdowns last fall. His 138 career catches are tied for fourth in program history, while his 1,608 receiving yards are 14th on the all-time list.\n\nHis production and testing numbers have sparked the interest of 10 NFL teams, including an AFC East organization, a source told The Inquirer.\n\n“I am excited, but at the same time, [I feel] nervous and impatient,” Barbon said about the draft. “I am just trying to get it over with at this point because you spend so much time training.”\n\nBarbon, who was born in Cuba, moved to the United States when he was 3 years old. He signed up for organized football in sixth grade and played at Conestoga Valley High School in Lancaster.\n\n» READ MORE: More women come forward with complaints about Temple football coach\n\nFollowing high school, multiple Division I programs offered Barbon, but he chose Temple. He’s faced ups and downs throughout his college career, including playing for three different head coaches (Geoff Collins, Rod Carey, and Stan Drayton) and various quarterbacks as Temple went just 15-29during his career.\n\n“Some guys were like, ‘Why [are] you still here? You should transfer out,’” Barbon said. “I always had that mindset [of] once I come here, I can’t go anywhere else.”\n\nAt the conclusion of his fifth season, Barbon declared for the NFL draft with one year of eligibility remaining. He told reporters at his pro day that NFL teams graded him as a Day 3 pick.\n\nTemple wide receivers coach Jafar Williams moved Barbon around on the field because of his savviness and praised his former player’s football IQ. Now, he’s confident that Barbon will find himself on an NFL training camp roster.\n\n“He is going to make a team,” Williams said about Barbon’s NFL chances. “[Another thing is that] Jose is very capable of doing is playing special teams. He’s one of those guys that can help you anywhere on the field. He’s the type of guy you want to coach and you want on your team because he is such a valuable asset.”\n\n» READ MORE: Owls’ Isaac Moore could extend football career to the professional level\n\nNFL teams can expect a few things out of Barbon, including making contested catches and beating cornerbacks with his speed. With an innate ability to adapt to new situations, he’s ideal for a sport that works well with players who can be versatile.\n\n“I wish everybody was like him, all the kids were like him, because anything I’ve asked him to do, he never once questioned,” Swift said. “Even though in his mind, he may not have understood the concept behind what I was asking him to do, he just did it and attacked it very, very aggressively.”",

(1:36)\n\nBoston Bruins captain Patrice Bergeron is questionable for Game 2 of their series against the Florida Panthers, coach Jim Montgomery said Tuesday.\n\nBergeron was a game-time decision for Boston's Game 1 victory on Monday but didn't end up taking the pregame skate. The center left the Bruins' regular-season finale at Montreal with an upper-body injury and was battling an illness that had swept through the Boston dressing room.\n\nMontgomery said Bergeron was \"feeling better,\" but he did not participate in an optional skate on Tuesday morning.\n\nBergeron, 37, had 58 points in 78 games this season. He's considered the best defensive forward in the NHL, having won the Selke Trophy a record five times.\n\nCenter Pavel Zacha replaced Bergeron on the Bruins' top line with Brad Marchand and Jake DeBrusk in Game 1. That line was paired against Panthers star Aleksander Barkov, who didn't record a point or have a shot on goal in the game.\n\n\"It's two lines against each other. You always want to win that battle,\" Zacha said. \"So that's the exciting part for me: To be in those positions to play against those lines.\"\n\nFlorida Panthers coach Paul Maurice said Barkov needs to learn to \"grind a playoff game\" rather than try to score coast-to-coast, which played into the Bruins' hands in Game 1.\n\nZacha said Bergeron has helped him behind the scenes on faceoffs and in getting him in the right mindset for the playoffs. \"I talked to him a little bit. I just told him that I didn't play in the playoffs in a while and he calmed me down. Just play, have fun there and battle hard,\" he said.\n\nZacha had the best season of his eight-year NHL career with Boston, having been traded there by the New Jersey Devils for Erik Haula last offseason. He had 21 goals and 36 assists in 82 games, all career highs.\n\nBruins winger Taylor Hall was teammates with Zacha when they were both with the Devils.\n\n\"I played with him in Jersey and I saw the potential that he had. Quite frankly, I saw him not really have a role there and not really have an identity as a player that was given to him,\" Hall said. \"I think once he got here, he was coached very well, he was given a lot of opportunity and he made the best of it. He's a great guy and he works hard. To see his growth from Jersey until now, it's been awesome for our team.\"\n\nGame 2 is in Boston on Wednesday night.\n\nMaurice would not name a starter for the Panthers in goal, as Alex Lyon gave up three goals on 29 shots in his playoff debut. Two-time Vezina Trophy winner Sergei Bobrovsky, who has appeared in 51 playoff games, was his backup.\n\n\"I think he was fantastic last night. I loved his game,\" Maurice said of Lyon.",

I don’t know,” Simms told McCarthy. “I just can’t picture Tom Brady up there announcing games. You know why? He’s Tom Brady. He’s just bigger than life…In this day and age, is it worth it for him?”\n\nFox Sports signed Brady to a 10-year deal in 2022, worth a whopping $375 million.\n\nSimms didn’t cast doubt as to whether Brady will one day be providing analysis on a panel or football field.\n\n“Hey, I think they’ll use him in different ways. I don’t care,” Simms added. “I’m going to say he doesn’t do games. They’ll put him on a pregame show and let him talk a little. There’s lots of ways to use him. He’s Tom Brady…He looks good. And he knows a lot of football, that’s for sure.\n\nMIAMI, FLORIDA – JANUARY 31: Former NFL player Phil Simms attends day 3 of SiriusXM at Super Bowl LIV on January 31, 2020 in Miami, Florida.

I will be.”\n\nTB12 Ready To Be A Star For FOX\n\nFox’s early game plan is to slot Brady in their booth over former Panthers tight end Greg Olsen, who’s performed exceptionally for the network.\n\nEven Simms had to give Olsen credit for his early success behind the microphone, which hasn’t been the case for every ex-NFL player (e.g., Tony Romo).\n\n“And you know, too, Greg Olsen did a good job this year. That has to make you sit back and wonder. So we’ll see,” Simms concluded.\n\nBrady noted during an interview on “The Herd with Colin Cowherd” that he’ll be ready to tackle the broadcasters booth in 2024.\n\n(Photo by Julio Aguilar/Getty Images)\n\nTB12 emphasized the importance of decompressing from a relentless 23-year NFL regimen.\n\n“Decompression’s important,” Brady said. “You’re on this kind of really crazy treadmill/hamster wheel for a long time — loving the moment, loving the journey at the same time. It’s a daily fight.\n\n“You wake up every day — just like you do and I have an appreciation for so many people that are so committed every day to showing up to put their max effort into their life and their career.\n\n“I think for me, I want to be great at what I do. And even talking last week with the people at Fox Sports and the leadership there, allowing me to start my FOX opportunity in the fall of 2024 is something that’s great for me.”\n\n.@TomBrady tells @ColinCowherd on @FS1 that he will start his broadcast career with FOX in the Fall of 2024. pic.twitter.com/rckDnIVeQO — Herd w/Colin Cowherd (@TheHerd) February 6, 2023\n\nIt’s a tough job being Tom Brady.\n\nFrom launching a clothing brand to charming Instagram models, few can traverse through life like TB12.\n\nSurely the GOAT will live up to the hype behind the mic. After all, we learned not to doubt Tom Brady 23 years ago.\n\nTom Brady with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after winning Super Bowl LV at Raymond James Stadium on February 07, 2021 in Tampa, Florida.

Alabama won’t be fielding a finished product this weekend, but the core structure of the 2023 Tide should be on display as Team Crimson and White face off.\n\nTHREE THINGS TO WATCH\n\n1. The Quarterbacks: For the first time since 2018, arguably 2016, Alabama’s offense didn’t have an outright No. 1 starting quarterback heading into the spring. We still don’t know who’ll take the majority of first team snaps this fall between Jalen Milroe or Ty Simpson. Milroe, who appeared in eight games last fall in relief of Bryce Young, is expected to get the “starting” nod against the first team defense this weekend with Simpson will face the second-team unit. Saban has talked about the “moments” and “progress” both have had and a productive day with zero turnovers could be an important step in either’s odds of winning the starting job.\n\n2. The rest of the offense: While most fans will be tuned in for the QBs, it’s important to note that the supporting cast will also be slightly altered from the one Young had last fall. Of the Tide’s six-leading receivers, three are no longer with the program. Of the five starting linemen from Week 1, three will be replaced. Establishing a consistent weapon in the passing game and keeping young upright were issues at times last year. Is a more balanced game plan the answer? With an impressive group of running backs and physical tight ends the potential strengths of the roster, Saturday can give a glimpse of what Alabama has planned for future opponents.\n\n3. The Freshmen: A couple of mid-year enrollees have earned some praise this spring. Safety Caleb Downs and running back Justice Haynes were cornerstones of the No. 1-ranked 2023 class and will get to show how their five-star designations translate to the field. Malik Benson will also make his debut at wide receiver. And Alabama’s two youngest quarterbacks, Eli Holstein and Dylan Lonergan, will have a chance to compete in front of a crowd.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nDefensive front versus offensive line\n\nA few expected contributors to Alabama’s defense will be sidelined as Dallas Turner and Deontae Lawson will be out with injuries. In late March, Saban said Justin Eboigbe likely won’t “be involved in the scrimmage at all.” In their place, a few underclassmen options can figure to get some playing time. Redshirt freshman Jeremiah Alexander, sophomore Jihaad Campbell and freshman Qua Russaw will have opportunities against a changing offensive line with five freshmen potentially rotating in.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n9 — It’s been nine years since Kevin Steele manned a sideline in Bryant-Denny Stadium as an Alabama coach. UA’s former linebacker’s coach and defensive coordinator, Steele is a veteran replacement for Pete Golding, who was hired at Ole Miss. Steele will be facing fellow new coordinator Tommy Rees as the latter seeks to build a more well-balanced Tide offense.\n\nBAMA PLAYER TO WATCH\n\nJunior offensive tackle JC Latham seems like the likely choice to shift over to the left side after starting all 13 games at right tackle a year ago. Tyler Steen’s presence and eventual transfer loomed last spring and there could be a transfer portal option to bolster Alabama’s depth (though they can’t be from the SEC due to new rules). At times last fall, Latham showed he can anchor one side of the line. The 6-foot-6, 335-pounder from Wisconsin will get a shot against Chris Braswell, if he’s active, and a few young pass rushers.\n\nNick Alvarez is a reporter for Alabama Media Group.

Experts say a mysterious spiral shape can appear in the night sky when a rocket vents unneeded fuel after launch. When the fuel is ejected, it freezes and crystallises in the shape of a spiral, which is then illuminated by the sun. In this latest instance, the upper stage of one of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets vented fuel shortly after lift-off, with a blue spiral then appearing over Hawaii. According to Spaceweather.com, 'SpaceX spirals' are a common sight over the Pacific.

An illuminating gyre in the sky sails through the aurora and over Donnelly Dome... Posted by AuroraHunter on Saturday, April 15, 2023\n\nHe photographed the mysterious shape, which appeared to be a giant hazy and glowing spiral galaxy hovering just above a mountain in the middle of green auroras.\n\nAnd he wasn't the only one.\n\nMiles away in northwest Alaska, Elizabeth Withnall had a similar sight.\n\n\"I was out aurora watching and saw the craziest thing in the sky,\" she wrote on Facebook. \"I always see strange things in the sky but this was insane.\"\n\nShe also captured images that show the same massive object heavily contrasted against the night sky.\n\nWithnall said she was hoping the mystery spiral would lead to the emergence of a spaceship and aliens, but according to Don Hampton of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, this event wasn't exactly related to a UFO.\n\nInstead, he told the Associated Press, it was actually something that he's witnessed himself about three times – fuel being released from a rocket.\n\n\"When they do that at high altitudes, that fuel turns into ice. And if it happens to be in the sunlight, when you're in the darkness on the ground, you can see it as a sort of big cloud, and sometimes it's swirly,\" he said. \"...it's not a galaxy...It's just water vapor reflecting sunlight.\"\n\nThis particular incident stemmed from a SpaceX rocket that launched from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base just hours before. According to Space.com, the Falcon 9 rocket had more than 50 satellites on board and lifted off at 2:48 a.m. ET.\n\nThe dumping of the fuel just happened to happen at the right time to be visible over Alaska, Hampton said, \"and we got that really cool looking spiral thing.\"",

                    "snippet": "The bizarre spiral appeared above Alaska on April 15. (Image credit: Todd Salat/AuroraHunter.com)\n\nAn ethereal whirlpool of light recently appeared in the night sky above Alaska, briefly stealing the limelight from a strong auroral display. But the bizarre, spiral-shaped object had nothing to do with the dancing polar lights.\n\nInstead, the luminous vortex was just the latest example of what astronomers have nicknamed \"SpaceX spirals,\" which are becoming an increasingly common sight for stargazers across the globe. These spirals form when rocket fuel, which is ejected from the fast-spinning upper stages of Falcon 9 rockets, gets frozen in space. These frozen swirls then reflect sunlight back towards Earth, which makes them visible to stunned onlookers on the ground.\n\nThe spiral was spotted in the sky above Alaska on April 15 at around midnight local time, while vibrant green Northern Lights were already dancing across the night sky, Spaceweather.com (opens in new tab) reported. The strange whirlpool was was filmed by cameras at the University of Alaska's Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks.\n\nThe video shows the spiral forming from an initial bright spot into a massive galaxy-shaped object, before gradually fading into nothingness. It was visible for around seven minutes.\n\n\"I was utterly surprised and mystified when I first spotted a distant bright light coming toward me from the northern horizon,\" Todd Salat (opens in new tab), an astrophotographer who captured an image (opens in new tab) of the spiral above Donnelly Dome near Delta Junction, told Spaceweather.com. \"At first I thought it was a jet airliner flying through some clouds. Then it took on the spiral shape and grew big fast!\"\n\nRelated: Eerie ring of red light flashes like a massive UFO above Italy. What was it?\n\nVideo footage of the spiral captured at the University of Alaska's Poker Flat Research Range. (Image credit: Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks)\n\nThe spiral was made up of fuel ejected by a Falcon 9 rocket that launched from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base around three hours before the whirlpool appeared. The rocket successfully deployed 51 satellites into Earth-orbit, bolstering both SpaceX's own Starlink constellation and satellite networks belonging to other private companies, SpaceNews (opens in new tab) reported.\n\nNot every SpaceX rocket launch leads to a SpaceX spiral. Many occur above the vast, empty expanse of the Pacific Ocean, or during the day when they are not visible at all. However, the spirals have become more common in recent years as the number of SpaceX launches has increased (opens in new tab).\n\nA still from the video footage captured at Poker Flat Research Range. (Image credit: Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks)\n\nOn Jan. 18, an eerily-perfect spiral was filmed above Hawaii by the Subaru-Asahi Star Camera, mounted on Mauna Kea and operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. The same camera also spied another striking spiral in April 2022 .\n\nIn June 2022, a frozen swirl was also snapped above New Zealand, Live Science's sister site Space.com (opens in new tab) reported.\n\nBut SpaceX is not the only cause of these rocket-derived light shows.",

                    "snippet": "On Monday, the most powerful rocket in the world sat on the launchpad in Boca Chica, Texas, ready for its first flight. But with less than ten minutes until takeoff, SpaceX called off the historic launch, citing a technical issue with the pressurization system.\n\nInstead, what would have been an uncrewed test flight of the company’s Starship rocket became a wet dress rehearsal, with engineers going through the motions of a countdown until about ten seconds to launch, when the attempt stopped. Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, said on Twitter they’ll attempt the flight again in a few days—now, launch is rescheduled for April 20.\n\nSpaceX hopes its Starship rocket will one day be used to fly astronauts and cargo to Earth orbit and eventually carry humans to the moon and Mars. It consists of the Starship upper stage spacecraft and the Super Heavy first stage booster—collectively referred to as Starship—and together, the stack of these two parts stands 394 feet tall. Starship is the largest rocket in the world, and its launch will be powered by more thrust than any other in history.\n\nOnce it has passed the necessary testing, Starship could serve a variety of purposes. NASA already plans to use the spacecraft as part of the Artemis program. During the Artemis 3 mission, which aims to land humans on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years, astronauts will fly to lunar orbit in NASA’s Orion capsule then travel in Starship between Orion and the moon’s surface.\n\nSpaceX could also use Starship to carry satellites for Starlink, its satellite-based internet service. But in the long-term, Musk is eyeing the Red Planet: He wants Starship to take people to live in a Martian colony, according to Time’s Jeffrey Kluger.\n\nLike Musk’s lofty plans for Starship, the rocket itself is ambitious. “It’s a very complex machine; it has so many different components,” Paulo Lozano, director of MIT’s space propulsion laboratory, tells NPR’s Geoff Brumfiel.\n\nThe Super Heavy booster alone stands 230 feet tall, and with an impressive 33 engines, it produces almost twice the thrust of NASA’s Space Launch System moon rocket that took off in November. And the Starship spacecraft, which could hold up to 100 people, has six engines and makes up the remaining 164 feet of the system’s height, per Marcia Dunn of the Associated Press. Together, the rocket can hold more than ten million pounds of propellant.\n\nThe whole system is made of stainless steel and powered by methane fuel. Neither is a very lightweight choice, but steel is durable and methane could be collected on Mars to power the rocket, writes NPR. And both of these materials are cheap to produce or acquire.\n\nSpaceX conducted five short test flights of just the upper-stage spacecraft between 2020 and 2021, according to Time. The fifth attempt was the first successful one, after the first four resulted in explosions or crashes. In February, the company performed a “static fire” test of its Super Heavy booster, igniting 31 of its 33 engines while it was attached to a platform, per Reuters’ Joe Skipper and Joey Roulette.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration gave SpaceX approval to test the whole system on Friday, write ABC News’ Meredith Deliso and Mary Kekatos.\n\nIn the upcoming test, the plan is for Super Heavy to detach from the spacecraft just under three minutes after launch. Then, the rocket will use a few engines to guide itself back to Earth, falling into the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile, the Starship spacecraft will complete almost an entire orbit of Earth and splash down in the Pacific Ocean no more than 90 minutes after launch, according to Space.com’s Andrew Jones.\n\nAfter a successful launch of the system, SpaceX intends to send the spacecraft with a crew into low-Earth orbit.\n\nUsing such a powerful rocket for a low-Earth orbit mission is rather like “using a sledgehammer to crack a nut,” Sa’id Mosteshar, director of the London Institute of Space Policy and Law, tells Time. But down the line, the rocket’s power could prove crucial to more distant space missions, provided all goes according to plan.",

There are four backup launch opportunities currently scheduled for the same day in case issues arise during the original window.\n\nSome 8 minutes and 26 seconds after launch, the rocket's first stage will attempt to land on the autonomous SpaceX droneship A Shortfall of Gravitas waiting nearby in the Atlantic Ocean. You can watch the action live here at Space.com courtesy of SpaceX.\n\nRelated: Starlink satellites: Everything you need to know\n\nSpaceX's V2 mini Starlink satellites are designed to be more powerful than earlier iterations, allowing for more broadband capacity than previous generations, according to the company (opens in new tab). They also feature Hall thrusters, which are electric propulsion systems that offer over twice the amount of thrust compared to those aboard first-generation Starlink satellites, SpaceX has said (opens in new tab).\n\nSpaceX already has over 4,000 Starlink satellites in orbit, but has plans to greatly increase that number. The company has regulatory approval to launch up to 12,000 more Starlink craft and is seeking permission to add a whopping 30,000 more.\n\nWhile the satellites will help bring broadband internet to remote or underserved locations around the globe, that amount of satellites also comes with its downsides, with astronomers complaining of Starlink craft interrupting science observations.\n\nWednesday's mission will mark the 25th flight for the company so far in 2023. The first stage booster flying this mission previously launched the private Hakuto-R rover to lunar orbit and three Starlink missions, in addition to other payloads.\n\nWhen it comes to upcoming SpaceX launches, however, all eyes are on the first space launch of the company's massive Starship rocket, which is currently targeted for Thursday (April 20). When Starship launches on the landmark test flight, it will assume the title of the world's most powerful rocket and pave the way for a new era of human spaceflight.",

Wodehouse just one day before he died of stomach cancer at the age of 43.\n\nIn an emotional essay for The New York Times, written “just days” after Nick’s March 25 passing in hospice care, the legendary composer, 75, lovingly shared that the father-son duo were speaking in Wodehouse quotes.\n\n“‘Here’s one for you,’ said Nick, laughing. He had surmised that, after bulletins from New York, his father, as Wodehouse might have put it, was less than gruntled,” Andrew wrote.\n\n“‘Has anybody ever seen a dramatic critic in the daytime? Of course not. They come out after dark, up to no good.’ We hugged and said our goodbyes.”\n\n“The next day, my son died,” the musical maven penned. “Nothing’s worse for a parent than the death of a child.”\n\nThe legendary composer shared that the father-son duo were “speaking in P.G. Wodehouse quotes.” Alan Davidson/Shutterstock\n\n“‘Has anybody ever seen a dramatic critic in the daytime? Of course not. They come out after dark, up to no good,'” Andrew wrote. “We hugged and said our goodbyes.” Instagram/andrewlloydwebber\n\nAndrew himself announced via Twitter that his second-oldest of five children had died, telling his followers at the time, “I am shattered to have to announce that my beloved elder son Nick died a few hours ago in Basingstoke Hospital.”\n\nThe UK native added, “His whole family is gathered together and we are all totally bereft,” signing off, “-ALW.”\n\nThe “Phantom of the Opera,” “Cats” and “Bad Cinderella” melodist was also the one who revealed Nick’s grave condition to the public on March 19.\n\nAndrew announced on March 25 that his eldest son had died in hospice after an 18-month battle with stomach cancer. He was 43. Credit: Emilio Madrid\n\n“I am absolutely devastated to say that my eldest son Nick is critically ill,” the EGOT winner told Page Six in a statement.\n\n“As my friends and family know, he has been fighting gastric cancer for the last 18 months and Nick is now hospitalized.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love …\n\nAndrew added that he and his loved ones were “all praying that Nick will turn the corner” as he “bravely” fought with his “indomitable humor.”\n\nNick, whom Andrew shared with first wife Sarah Hugill, had been following in his famous dad’s footsteps and was even nominated for a Grammy after scoring the original cast recording of “Cinderella” in 2021.\n\n“Nothing’s worse for a parent than the death of a child,” the melodist penned. Alan Davidson/Shutterstock\n\nBut in an effort to be judged on his own merit, Nick “dropped the Lloyd bit” of his last name.\n\n“I got some stuff on the radio, so I thought, ‘OK, I’m obviously not a complete idiot,'” the late composer told The Telegraph in 2011.\n\n“Then I thought, ‘Hang on, if other people are prepared to work with me without the surname, then maybe I should just get on with it.'”",

Wodehouse quotes with my eldest son, Nick, who was in hospice, where he was being treated for cancer just days ago.'\n\nHeartbreaking: Andrew Lloyd Webber has recalled his final moments with late son Nick (also pictured with daughter Imogen and wife Charlotte Windmill in 2010)\n\nHe continued: '\"Here's one for you,\" said Nick, laughing. He had surmised that, after bulletins from New York, his father, as Wodehouse might have put it, was less than gruntled.\n\n'\"Has anybody ever seen a dramatic critic in the daytime? Of course not. They come out after dark, up to no good.\" We hugged and said our goodbyes.\n\n'The next day, my son died. Nothing's worse for a parent than the death of a child.'\n\nLloyd Webber went on to write that it felt 'wrong in his bones' to write about Broadway just days after the death of his child but reasoned that he owed 'everything' to his love of the theatre.\n\nHe concluded his essay by noting 'this has been a season of goodbyes, personal and public.'\n\nLloyd Webber confirmed that his eldest son had died in a tweet last month, writing: 'I am shattered to have to announce that my beloved elder son Nick died a few hours ago in Basingstoke Hospital.\n\n'His whole family is gathered together and we are all totally bereft. - ALW'\n\nNicholas followed in his father's footsteps and was a successful composer in his own right, having written Fat Friends The Musical.\n\nHe was married to musician Polly Wiltshire, who appeared on the soundtrack of his father's 2019 movie Cats.\n\nDuring his career, Nicholas also scored music for an adaption of The Little Prince as well as composing numerous TV and film scores, including for the BBC1 drama Loves, Lies, and Records.\n\nDedication: Nick died last month after a battle with gastric cancer and pneumonia , with Lloyd Webber, 75, dedicating the final curtain call of Phantom of the Opera to his beloved late son\n\nOn Monday, Lloyd Webber dedicated the final curtain call of Phantom of the Opera to Nick as the sensational Broadway show ended after 35 years.\n\nThe cast and crew took their final bows on stage Sunday, concluding New York's longest-running show with thunderous standing ovations, champagne toasts and gold and silver confetti bursting from its famous chandelier.\n\nIt was show No. 13,981 at the Majestic Theatre and it ended with a reprise of The Music of the Night performed by the current cast, previous actors in the show - including original star Sarah Brightman - and crew members in street clothes.\n\nLloyd Webber wearing a suit and black tie, spoke of how Nick had listened to the same music as a child.\n\n'When he was a little boy, he heard some of this music,' Lloyd Webber said. Brightman, holding his hand, agreed: 'When Andrew was writing it, he was right there. So his son is with us. Nick, we love you very much.'\n\nThe first production opened in London in 1986 and since then the show has been seen by more than 145 million people in 183 cities and performed in 17 languages over 70,000 performances.\n\nThe musical - a fixture on Broadway since opening on January 26, 1988 - has weathered recessions, war, terrorism and cultural shifts.\n\nBut the prolonged pandemic may have been the last straw: It's a costly musical to sustain, with elaborate sets and costumes as well as a large cast and orchestra.",

It was a \"season of goodbyes, personal and public,\" Lloyd Webber wrote in a new essay for New York Times.\n\nLloyd Webber begins the essay by reflecting on his last visit with his son while Nick was in hospice. \"The next day, my son died,\" he writes.\n\nNick Webber, who was a Grammy-nominated composer and record producer, died in March from gastric cancer and pneumonia. The son of Lloyd Webber and his first wife, Sarah Hugill, he was 43.\n\n\"Nothing's worse for a parent than the death of a child. In my bones I feel it wrong to write about the closing of 'Phantom' or where Broadway's going right now,\" Lloyd Webber writes. \"But I'll try.\"\n\nSarah Brightman, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cameron Mackintosh at the closing performance of \"Phantom of the Opera\" held at Majestic Theatre on April 16, 2023 in New York City. Nina Westervelt / Variety via Getty Images\n\nLloyd Webber is behind 13 Broadway musicals, including \"Cats,\" \"Evita\" and current Broadway production \"Bad Cinderella.\" He shared that in 1985, he was inspired to write a musical based on the book \"The Phantom of the Opera\" and together with his late friend and collaborator, Hal Prince, he made it happen.\n\nThe show ran for a record 35 years. \"It's a personal loss to see the close of this wonderful creation, the last Hal Prince production on Broadway, with its almost 30-piece orchestra and one of the grandest designs that have ever been seen in the theater. The irony is that this past season was its best ever. Perhaps it will rise again,\" he writes.\n\nLloyd Webber said that it is not the end of Broadway – but Broadway must improve. He said ticket costs are too expensive and theater conditions must improve, including wait times for restrooms during intermission, and said theater unions must help in the effort. \"It's hugely in their members' interests to ensure a healthy, vibrant Broadway. The way multiple union contracts drive up the costs of Broadway shows is unsustainable,\" he writes.\n\nBroadway theaters took a major hit in March 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered their doors for months. Last year, many shows were still seeing a decrease in ticket sales and empty seats, according to CBS New York, but Broadway League President Charlotte St. Martin said at the time \"the rumors of our death are wildly exaggerated.\"\n\nStill, many shows have struggled to survive.\n\n\"With the curtain now fallen in New York on the musical that has been the biggest of my career, I passionately pray that Broadway rediscovers the appetite for new scores and original work that made me so excited when I was, as Hal always called me, a kid,\" he writes.\n\nDuring the final performance of \"Phantom,\" Lloyd Webber joined the curtain call, according to CBS New York. \"I hope you won't mind if I dedicate this performance to my son,\" he said.\n\n\"Nick, we love you very much,\" said Sarah Brightman, who originated the lead role Christine in 1986 and was married to Lloyd Webber from 1984-1990.",

                    "snippet": "The situation has gone from “Bad” to worse.\n\nOver at Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Bad Cinderella” on Broadway, advertising agency RPM and the production have cut ties — with just two weeks to go until Tony Award nominations are announced.\n\n“The change has been made to work more strategically to find our audience,” producer Christine Schwarzman told The Post.\n\n“Setting this new course, we found ourselves not aligned with our previous marketing agency in terms of steps that needed to be taken. We agreed to part ways and wish them the best.”\n\nA person close to RPM, however, bristled, saying that the campaign was “the only good thing” about the maligned musical and that the agency had resigned the account.\n\nSchwarzman noted that the production is now working with SpotCo, Sine Digital and Super Awesome Friends.\n\nRegardless, for “Bad Cinderella,” midnight grows ever closer.\n\nThe show show received across-the-board pans from critics — “a wacko fairytale dumpster fire,” said The Post; “Bring earplugs … Bring eye plugs,” echoed the Times.\n\nOn March 25, the day after it opened, a source claimed the show did a paltry $80,000 in ticket sales.\n\nAnother said the number was “significantly higher,” but box-office business has demonstrably not been brisk.\n\nFor a more than $20 million musical, $750,000 would have been an ideal take after the enhanced visibility from reviews. But the notices were lousy and word of mouth stinks.\n\nIts weekly grosses are anemic — the show took in just $571,000 last week, which was its second lowest take so far — and the advance is said to be nonexistent.\n\nProducer Christine Schwarzman says the musical “Bad Cinderella” is charting “a new course.” Variety via Getty Images\n\nMultiple sources also said there has been little communication between Lloyd Webber and Schwarzman, and that the two disagree on whether the money-draining musical should remain open.\n\nThey claim the legendary composer says no, and the fledgling producer says yes.\n\nA spokesman for Lloyd Webber denied the spat.\n\n“Andrew and Christine have been thick as thieves lately. They dined together, and she was with him at ‘Morning Joe’ and ‘The Tonight Show’ yesterday,” he said.\n\nLast week onstage at the Imperial Theatre, Lloyd Webber — whose “The Phantom of the Opera” closed Sunday after 35 years — defended his latest show and suggested the crowd throw “well-aimed apples” at New York theater critics.\n\nThe show received across-the-board pans from critics. Evan Zimmerman\n\nThe original Broadway campaign for the show featured a stark red color scheme and in-your-face messaging.\n\nIn one recent online ad, the New York Times review is defaced and replaced with plaudits from renowned theater critic Bethenny Frankel of “The Real Housewives of New York City.”\n\n“I laughed, I enjoyed it, it’s f – – king fun. And fabulous!” Frankel’s quote reads.\n\nNow, an incredulous source said Schwarzman “wants all the advertising to look like Rodgers and Hammerstein.”\n\n“Bad Cinderella” already had a more traditional sales pitch in London, where the show was simply called “Cinderella.”\n\nThe West End poster was a calm, royal blue, but the production was still a flop that closed early.\n\nThe musical is a modern spin on the old fairy tale. Bruce Glikas/WireImage\n\nBut Schwarzman isn’t leaving the ball just yet.\n\n“We’re going to fight to keep our show going while we reach our broader audience,” she said.\n\n“We know the odds of success, but we wouldn’t be producers worth our salt if we didn’t make every smart move we can to back our show, our company and one of the greatest musical theater artists of all time.”\n\nShe’s right about one thing: The chances of “Bad Cinderella” becoming a profitable hit are tiny — or, as the Fairy Godmother in Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “Cinderella” sings, “Impossible!” — even if it scores a healthy number of Tony nods on May 2.\n\nAnd that’s hardly guaranteed in a crowded field of musicals.\n\nOver in London, the show only managed a single Olivier Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical, which it did not win.\n\nThat empty-handed trend could be repeated stateside.\n\n“It will be shut out from every Tony,” a source said.",

                    "snippet": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Jake Haener bristles when asked about the obvious comparison to fellow experienced but undersized quarterback Brock Purdy.\n\n“I just feel like Brock is different. I’m different. There’s different things that we do in our games,” said Haener, the former Fresno State star. “Brock did a lot of really good things. Super happy for him and his family. But at the same time, I’m on my own mission, on my own train and trying to do something for a franchise that believes in me.”\n\nPurdy’s presence hovers over this year’s draft class after the overlooked quarterback who got tabbed with the “Mr. Irrelevant” moniker after being drafted with the final pick last year developed into a gem who won his first seven starts and helped the San Francisco 49ers make it to the NFC championship game.\n\nPurdy’s surprising performance as a rookie could open the door for more teams to be willing to take a late-round chance in next week’s draft on other successful college quarterbacks who might lack the elite size or arm strength.\n\n“I can totally appreciate that,” said Haener, who is projected as an early Day 3 draft pick. “People can go measure the things that the big, tall, strong guys who throw the ball great, throw it out of the stadium. But at the end of the day, you got to go win football games and you got to put the ball where it’s supposed to be and you got to make the right decisions and you got to protect the football. Brock does all those things really well and at a really high level.”\n\nPurdy nearly didn’t get the chance to prove that after being repeatedly passed over in the draft last year before the 49ers took him with the final pick.\n\nPHOTOS: Purdy's success could open door for other QBs in NFL draft\n\nThe Niners had been impressed with Purdy but were hesitant to draft him because they had 2021 first-rounder Trey Lance slated to be the starter and had given Nate Sudfeld $2 million in guaranteed money to be the backup.\n\n“We weren’t going to spend a fifth-round pick on him because it was going to be tough for him to beat out Sudfeld,” coach Kyle Shanahan said. “We probably weren’t going to keep three guys. We spent our seventh-round pick on him because he was by far the best guy available. Then he played at a high level and we didn’t want to lose him so we kept him on our team and we kept three quarterbacks.”\n\nPurdy beat out Sudfeld and made the roster behind Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo, who made a surprise return after no team wanted to trade for the former starter.\n\nThen after Lance and Garoppolo went down with injuries, Purdy stepped in and led the Niners to wins in the final five regular season games to win the NFC West. He followed that up with two playoff wins before going down with a serious elbow injury in the first quarter of the NFC title game loss to Philadelphia.\n\nNow the Niners are planning to have Purdy as the starter in 2023 - assuming he recovers from elbow surgery - with a salary of less than $900,000.\n\n“Those late-round guys are like lottery tickets to me and Brock Purdy was a great example of that,” said ESPN draft analyst Jordan Reid. “We’ve seen guys in years past that have gone on to be those Day 3 players they have turned into starters and even if they don’t turn into a starter for you, they end up turning into assets, too. You never know what they could turn into.”\n\nTeams had shied away in recent years from taking a late-round flyer on quarterbacks as fewer teams kept three quarterbacks on the roster after the NFL eliminated the game-day roster exemption for an emergency third quarterback.\n\nIn the first nine drafts after former sixth-round pick Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl following the 2002 season, there were an average of seven QBs taken in the final three rounds of the draft.\n\nThat has dropped off significantly in the last 12 drafts, with an average of just more than four QBs getting taken each year in the fifth, sixth or seventh rounds.\n\nReid sees that changing this year with his seven-round mock draft projecting seven quarterbacks getting drafted in the final three rounds.\n\n“I think we’re going to see a record number be selected just so you can have that QB 3 as insurance or you could end up having a Brock Purdy type of situation where you end up hitting on a late-round player,” he said.\n\nHaener is one of those possibilities, after throwing for 9,120 yards and making 29 starts in college, to go after the top QBs like Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud, Anthony Richardson, Will Levis and Hendon Hooker are taken early.\n\nTwo-time national champion Stetson Bennett of Georgia, Purdue’s Aidan O’Connell, BYU’s Jaren Hall, Houston’s Clayton Tune, UCLA’s Dorian Thompson-Robinson and TCU’s Max Duggan also could be in that Day 3 mix.\n\n“It doesn’t really matter where you get picked,” Duggan said. “Whatever team you end up with, make the most of it. It’s ultimately up to: Was it the right fit, are you with the right people, right franchise, all of that.”",

                    "snippet": "Just a few years ago, Linedy Genao was finding her way in the financial world, working as a banking assistant.\n\nThen, something got in the way of her career plans: She became a Broadway star.\n\nGenao, 31, plays Cinderella in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new musical, “Bad Cinderella.” It’s the latest chapter in a fairy tale for our times; going from working as a bank teller to landing her first Broadway role by submitting a headshot that she snapped on her phone.\n\nThe New York-born and Connecticut-raised actress, who’s the first Latina to originate a starring role in a Lloyd Webber show, didn’t plan on being an actress. She found her way from banking to Broadway almost on a whim. But she’s still got her finance background to fall back on; when theaters shut down during the pandemic, for example, she went back to banking for a period.\n\nSo MarketWatch caught up with Genao this week to hear her Cinderella story. Here’s what we learned.\n\nWhat drew her to finance in the first place?\n\nGenao says she originally planned on a career in international business. She was inspired in part by her aunt, who runs a travel agency in the Dominican Republic, where her family hails from. “I wanted to do a line of work that allowed me to travel while making money,” Genao says.\n\nShe started working as a teller for TD Bank while attending the University of Connecticut, where she majored in business administration. After college, Genao found a job as an associate at Interaudi, a private New York-based bank. Her position was in the card department, where she handled charge disputes, fraudulent transactions and other matters. And she aspired to work her way up to a bigger role.\n\nHow did Broadway enter the picture?\n\nGenao always loved singing, noting that her family was very involved in the church choir. She discovered musical theater in high school, where she landed roles in shows. But she didn’t think she could make a career out of it, especially given that she was rejected by colleges with strong musical theater programs. So, she saw the arts as a side passion, at first — she performed in community theater and with a community chorus in her spare time.\n\nBut after just 11 months with Interaudi Bank, she got a Facebook message from a high-school friend she acted with in shows, pointing her to an upcoming audition for the Broadway musical “On Your Feet!” about the life and career of Gloria Estefan, the Latina musical icon. The friend insisted that Genao’s name was “written all over it.”\n\nAt the time, Genao didn’t even have the requisite headshot needed for such an audition, so she took a selfie on her phone and then printed that out at a local pharmacy. “It was a horrendous picture,” she recalls.\n\nDid Genao get the gig?\n\nYes. She was in the show’s ensemble, and also understudied the lead role of Gloria. “I could not believe this was happening,” says Genao. From there, she did regional shows and appeared on the first national tour of “Dear Evan Hansen,” the Tony-winning Broadway musical.\n\nAnd that was the end of her banking career?\n\nNot quite. Like so many performers, Genao found herself unemployed when theaters closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, she got an opportunity to return to Interaudi, working virtually as an independent contractor. Eventually, the bank even wanted to make her a regular employee again.\n\nGenao says that she was tempted to “go back to a set career with a set salary.” But her heart was now in show business — and she landed a part in the Broadway production of “Dear Evan Hansen” as Broadway theaters reopened.\n\nMore recently, the opportunity arose to play Cinderella, which is her first Broadway lead role.\n\nWhat is it like being the star in an Andrew Lloyd Webber show?\n\nGenao says that working with Lloyd Webber, the theatrical legend whose “Phantom of the Opera” recently closed, is a collaborative process. “I can’t think of how many times he’ll ask me, ‘Are you happy with this?’” In the process, she says that Lloyd Webber has made her a more comfortable and confident performer.\n\nStill, Genao has had to deal with the fact that “Bad Cinderella,” a cheeky take on the classic tale, has generally been panned by the theatrical press. “It hurts to see that,” she says. She adds that the show’s audience is not the critics, but the theatergoers she finds cheering on the cast with each performance: “Our show is fun and joyous and the audience every night loves it.”\n\nLinedy Genao stars as Cinderella in the new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, “Bad Cinderella,” but she started her career in banking before moving to Broadway. Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman\n\nDoes Genao see connections between being in banking and being on stage?\n\nAbsolutely. She explains that basic employment skills — being efficient with your time, having a good work ethic — are applicable to both gigs. Plus, her banking work has helped her to be a stickler with details when reading performance contracts, she says.\n\nGenao has also become interested in the financial side of Broadway. “I love asking about the business aspects of the show. It’s incredible to perform, but the numbers do matter,” she says. Genao adds that if the acting thing doesn’t work out, she might try her hand working in publicity on shows, or even producing.\n\nBut for now, she’s committed to playing Cinderella eight times a week and enjoying a career she never imagined she’d have.",

Suddenly, 45-year-old Jose Garcia, who has 11 prior arrests, walks up behind her and clocks her on the side of the head with the bottle.\n\nA CCTV camera captured the moment a man hit an NYPD officer over the head with a bottle\n\nHe then started landing blows on her male partner and was swiftly put in a headlock by a third officer. Meanwhile, the female officer ran off into the road with her head in her hand. The injured police officer was reportedly taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where she was treated and determined to be in stable condition. According to NYC Scoop, the woman attacked was an officer at 50th Precinct in Queens. Sources told the Post she was in the Bronx conducting smoke shop inspections as a number of smoke shops have started illegally selling cannabis.\n\nThe attack happened near to 231st Street and Broadway outside Delicious Deli and Alltown Car Service\n\nThe incident was recorded on CCTV footage, which also shows two men on the street filming before the attack. It appears in another video that the police were conducting some sort of operation on the Delicious Deli, nearby to where the broad daylight attack took place, which was drawing public attention. Pedestrians on the road can be heard reacting in shock after the officers were struck. Garcia was arrested and charged with assault, obstruction of governmental administration, resisting arrest, menacing, criminal possession of a weapon and harassment, police told the New York Post.\n\nTrending\n\nVideo recorded from another angle shows an NYC Sheriff walking from a parked van towards the deli",

                    "snippet": "The Phantom of the Opera, Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical that closed its Broadway run on Sunday after 35 years, went out on a very high note: Box office receipts for the show’s final week hit a best-ever $3,739,934.\n\nPlaying, of course, to standing room only audiences at longtime venue the Majestic Theatre, Phantom commanded a hefty $287 average ticket price during its home stretch week (Sunday’s final performance was invitation-only and heavily comped).\n\nAmong the shows of a more recent vintage, Peter Pan Goes Wrong, the latest comedy from the Mischief theater company folks, took in $903,540, a startlingly strong figure for a new non-musical play. The combination of Mischief’s reputation (the troupe was behind the very popular The Play That Goes Wrong) and current guest star Neil Patrick Harris (he’s on board until April 30) proved irresistible to ticket-buyers, who paid an average $113.67 per ticket and filled 95% of seats at the Ethel Barrymore. Opening night is tomorrow.\n\nThe strong showings of both shows contributed to the Broadway total of $38,474,982 for the week ending April 16. Total attendance was 282,895. The total tally for the 34 productions held even from the previous week.\n\nTwo shows opened last week, with Fat Ham getting the more consistently positive reviews but filling fewer seats, percentage-wise, than Aaron Sorkin’s adaptation of Camelot.

His father had passed away when Stanley was an infant. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Richmond, and a Bachelor of Divinity from Southwestern Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He later earned Master of Theology and Doctor of Theology degrees from Luther Rice Seminary in Atlanta.\n\nDr. Charles Stanley was known to many television audiences across the nation for his weekly sermons. WUPA/First Baptist Atlanta\n\nBefore joining the staff at First Baptist Church of Atlanta as associate pastor in 1969, Stanley served as part of the pastoral staff at Fruitland Baptist Church in Hendersonville, North Carolina, First Baptist Church of Fairborn, Ohio; First Baptist Church of Miami; and First Baptist Church in Bartow, Fla.\n\nTwo years after becoming the senior pastor at First Baptist Atlanta, in 1971, Stanley launched his television ministry with the 30-minute \"The Chapel Hour,\" on two Atlanta stations. In 1978, the Christian Broadcasting Network contacted Stanley about a nationally broadcast program, seeking a Bible-teaching element for its fledgling satellite network. The renamed \"In Touch with Dr. Charles Stanley\" grew overnight from its core local audience to a devoted nationwide base.\n\nAs of the time of his death, Stanley's weekly messages were heard in more than 127 languages around the globe via television, radio, shortwave, and via the internet. Stanley had become the nation's longest-serving pastor with a continuous weekly broadcast program.\n\nStanley served two terms as president of the Southern Baptist Convention -- in 1985 and 1986. He was inducted into the National Religious Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1988. He was named Clergyman of the Year by Religious Heritage of America in 1989.\n\nDr. Charles F. Stanley, Pastor Emeritus of First Baptist Atlanta, passed away this morning at home. We are grateful for his enduring legacy of faithful leadership and spiritual guidance as Senior Pastor of FBA for over 50 years.

Stanley was also noted for his photography, and the walls of the In Touch Ministries headquarters in Atlanta were filled with images from his personal travels.\n\nStanley stepped down from the active role of senior pastor in September 2020, and into the role of pastor emeritus.\n\nHe is survived by his son, Andy Stanley, founder and senior pastor of North Point Ministries, his daughter Becky Stanley Broderson; six grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; and half-sister Susie Cox.

                    "snippet": "I grew up among a hodge-podge of denominations and religious movements, from Catholicism, to Church of God in Christ, to Southern Baptist. Along with the extremes from confessional to charismania, much of the preaching I heard ranged from works and acts of service to hellfire and brimstone. Three guesses on who trafficked the most in the “turn or burn” language. While fear of eternal damnation is a powerful motivator, it’s not a permanent basis to build a relationship with God. Southern Baptist pastor, teacher, and radio broadcaster Dr. Charles Stanley seemed to have understood this. His theological training and denomination were Southern Baptist, but his teaching was rooted in scripture, and his delivery was that of a passionate instructor who wanted to ensure you understood the depth and importance of his message, more than a gleeful deliverer of fear, loathing, and divine retribution.\n\nAs a person of faith and a curious observer and journalist, I have watched many of Dr. Charles Stanley’s contemporaries fail, fall, or flame out. Yet, Dr. Stanley maintained as pastor of First Baptist Church of Atlanta for 50 years before he willingly stepped down in 2020 at the age of 87. The church is considered one of the most diverse congregations in the world, with a membership of people from across the state of Georgia, with origins from 98 different countries.\n\nFounded in 1972, Dr. Stanley’s In Touch Ministries radio and television program reached audiences who normally shunned Southern Baptist preaching. Consider that period in time: The Jesus Movement was transforming the nation and the world and the new media of evangelical television was moving into prominence. It is a testament to Dr. Stanley’s integrity, consistency, and commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ that In Touch Ministries is well known, well respected, and still transforming lives 51 years later.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Charles Stanley departed this life for his desired heavenly home. He was 90 years old.\n\nMy first introduction to Dr. Charles Stanley’s began in my freshman year at Tuskegee University by his radio broadcast. He attracted and was highly respected by a multi-denominational audience. He was an effective teacher of the Scriptures and will be greatly missed. pic.twitter.com/3zgY8oMFLO — WR Felton (@BishopWRFelton) April 18, 2023\n\nFrom Fox 5 Atlanta:\n\nDr. Charles Frazier Stanley, the senior pastor at First Baptist Church Atlanta and the founder of In Touch Ministries has died. FOX 5’s Buck Lanford has confirmed First Baptist Atlanta Senior Pastor Anthony Georgia that the influential Atlanta faith leader passed away peacefully at his home Tuesday morning. For more than five decades, the pastor, broadcaster, and author served on the staff of First Baptist Atlanta. He was named Senior Pastor in 1971, becoming the 16th pastor at the historic church that was founded in 1848. Under Stanley’s leadership, the church saw unprecedented growth. In 1997, FBA moved from its Midtown Atlanta location on Peachtree Street to the former Avon property in Dunwoody to accommodate its diverse membership of more than 15,000 from all over the metro area.\n\nIn Touch Family, this morning, God called our beloved pastor, Dr. Charles Stanley, home to heaven. Dr. Stanley lived a life of obedience and is now receiving the joy of his soul—seeing his Savior face-to-face. Please join us in praying for the Stanley family. pic.twitter.com/8h2ROcoHuF — In Touch Ministries (@InTouchMin) April 18, 2023\n\nChristianity Today offered this tribute:\n\nCharles Stanley once took a punch to the face for his church. The longtime pastor and oft-praised preacher, who died on Tuesday at age 90, fought hard to lead in his Southern Baptist congregation, earning him a reputation for faithful obstinacy, a commitment to following God’s will, and a life of devout prayer. He frequently repeated his life motto, which he learned from his grandfather: “Obey God and leave all the consequences to him.” That kind of obedience wouldn’t come without cost, Stanley said, but God rewards stubborn faith. “Granddad told me, ‘Charles, if God tells you to run your head through a brick wall, you head for the wall,’” he wrote in his 2016 memoir, “‘and when you get there, God will make a hole for it.’” Stanley was the pastor at First Baptist Church Atlanta for 51 years. He started as associate minister in 1969, when the megachurch had 5,000 members, and remained in the pulpit until 2020, when it had about 15,000 members. He also preached daily on the radio and television through In Touch Ministries, which he founded in 1972, and was widely regarded as one of the best preachers of his generation, along with Charles Swindoll and Billy Graham.\n\nCharles Stanley went to Heaven today. He made his mark on this world for the Gospel and his incredible teaching of God’s Word. I like so many others was blessed by hearing his messages on the radio and TV and he was a trusted voice we have all been encouraged… pic.twitter.com/E8qpVqQ1HS — Greg Laurie (@greglaurie) April 18, 2023\n\nIn 50 years of ministry, the one flaw that could be attributed to it ended up being a beautiful example of Dr. Stanley’s dependence upon God in the midst of his pain, failure, and loss, as well as a testament of the grace of God. I remember it was quite stunning to many when Dr. Stanley announced on his program that after almost 40 years of marriage, his wife wanted a divorce. Dr. asked others to pray for them, and focused on God’s will and Kingdom rather than his own distress. Because of his marital troubles, Dr. Stanley endured a battle over whether he could continue as pastor of First Baptist Church of Atlanta, and this battle affected his relationship with his son, the Rev. Andy Stanley, and led to their estrangement.\n\nThe greatest fight of Stanley’s ministry, however, was the fight to save his marriage and stay in the pulpit after his divorce. Anna Stanley filed for divorce in 1993, without explanation and using only the couple’s initials, A. S. and C. S. The news got out anyway and caused an uproar at First Baptist Church. The congregation had never allowed a divorced man to serve in ministry, and Stanley had taught that divorced men were disqualified from ministry. Stanley announced from the pulpit that the couple was not getting divorced, but was separated and working on their marriage. Anna amended the suit a week later to ask for formal separation instead of divorce and then dropped the case. She filed again in 1995. “I am dismayed by my husband’s refusal to accept the critical state of our marriage,” Anna Stanley said in a statement to the Atlanta Constitution. “Instead, he has made repeated announcements from the pulpit that progress was being made towards our reconciliation, when in fact, the very opposite was true. I do not choose to contribute to this charade.” There were no allegations of infidelity or immoral behavior. Anna said her husband had long made his priorities clear, and she wasn’t one of them.\n\nIn the end, Stanley maintained his pastorate, but could not sustain his marriage.\n\nThe church voted to keep Stanley, even if the separation continued. When Anna filed for divorce a third time in 2000 and succeeded in ending the marriage, a board member announced that Stanley would continue as senior pastor. The congregation responded to the news with a standing ovation.\n\nHowever, it was from a different and more vulnerable place that Stanley delivered his teachings, and it had an impact on people who had previously dismissed him.\n\n“It was Romans 8:28. God knew what he was doing,” Stanley said. “People would say, ‘I used to couldn’t watch you. What do you know about loneliness and hurt and pain and suffering and loss. Now I can watch you because now I know you know how I feel.’” Stanley reconciled with his son through counseling, the two megachurch pastors going to therapy together. The elder Stanley talked about the death of his father, his traumatic relationship with his stepfather, and his need to maintain control. He invited Andy to preach at First Baptist Church in 2007. The younger Stanley’s sermon was on a familiar theme: “The Cost of Following Christ.”\n\nDr. Stanley is survived by his son Andy, his daughter, Becky Stanley Brodersen, and six grandchildren.\n\nEditor’s Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly indicated In Touch Ministries was founded in 1977.

                    "snippet": "ATLANTA (AP) — Charles Stanley, a prominent televangelist who once led the Southern Baptist Convention, died Tuesday at his home in Atlanta at age 90, In Touch Ministries announced.\n\nNo cause of death was announced.\n\nBorn in rural Dry Fork, Virginia, Stanley was senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Atlanta for 50 years. The church grew rapidly after he became its leader in 1971, moving from central Atlanta to a suburban campus in 1997 to accommodate a growing flock in the sprawling urban area.\n\n“We are forever grateful for his enduring legacy of faithful leadership and spiritual guidance,” the church said in a social media post.\n\nBut his greatest fame came from his role in hosting “In Touch with Dr. Charles Stanley,” a Christian teaching program that began airing on the newborn Christian Broadcasting Network in 1978. That led to the creation of a separate nonprofit, In Touch Ministries, that sent Stanley's broadcasts across the nation and world through radio and television. It even created solar-powered audio players containing the Bible, some of Stanley's sermons and other materials that are available in more than 100 languages. Stanley also wrote more than 40 books.\n\nPolitical Cartoons View All 949 Images\n\nWhen Stanley stepped down from First Baptist as senior pastor in 2020, he said he wasn’t planning to stop preaching, instead focusing his energies on In Touch Ministries.\n\n“I’ll continue to preach the gospel as long as God allows, and my goal remains the same: to get the truth of the gospel to as many people as possible as quickly as possible in the power of the Holy Spirit to the glory of God,” Stanley said in a video message to the church when he took on the title of pastor emeritus.\n\nStanley served two one-year terms as president of the Southern Baptist Convention in 1985 and 1986, at the peak of a time when theological conservatives were fighting to oust more moderate leaders from leadership roles in the convention and its seminaries, saying the church needed to be truer to Biblical authority.\n\n“My election infuriated the opposition and ultimately revealed many of the underlying problems that had existed in the convention for a long time but had either been ignored or denied,\" Stanley wrote in a 2016 autobiography. \"All the liberal and moderate political forces of the Southern Baptist Convention were against me, which included seminary presidents and state convention newspapers.”\n\nIn his first term, Stanley helped stop congregations from ordaining women. His second election in 1985 was bolstered by a last-minute telegram of support from famous evangelist Billy Graham, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\n“After Stanley’s election, the battle subsided and eventually the moderates moved on from the fight or away from the denomination,” Ed Stetzer, executive director of Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College in Illinois, told the newspaper.\n\nStanley was also a devoted photographer of nature and the outdoors, with many of pictures reproduced by In Touch publications.\n\nStanley separated from his longtime wife, Anna, in the 1990s, before divorcing in 2000. Although First Baptist had barred divorced men as ministers, and Stanley had once said he would resign if his wife left him, the church affirmed him remaining pastor.\n\nSome other evangelical Christians panned the decision. Dissenters included his son, Andy Stanley, who said he wanted his father to offer to quit and let the church decide. Instead, it was Andy Stanley who left the congregation and founded Northpoint Ministries, a network of eight evangelical Christian churches in Atlanta and its suburbs. He and his sister Becky survive Charles Stanley,\n\nDespite the split, Andy Stanley told WAGA-TV that his father was a role model for pastors.\n\n“Not just how to preach or how to build a church,\" said Andy Stanley. “But how to get to a finish line with integrity and to be able to look back and be proud of everything that came before, and unfortunately that’s increasingly rare.”",

Stanley, a past president of the nation’s largest Protestant denomination and a noted evangelical TV and radio broadcaster, died Tuesday at age 90, In Touch Ministries announced.\n\nNo cause of death was given, but the group said Mr. Stanley passed away at 7:30 a.m. He served 50 years as senior pastor of the First Baptist Church of Atlanta starting in 1971, having joined as associate pastor two years earlier. He was elected to successive one-year terms as Southern Baptist Convention president, in 1984 and 1985.\n\nMr. Stanley’s broadcast ministry began with a 30-minute TV program called “The Chapel Hour” that aired on local stations WXIA and WANX (now WGCL). The Christian Broadcasting Network offered an opportunity to transmit those messages, and the program was renamed “In Touch with Dr. Charles Stanley,” a nod to his theology doctorate from Luther Rice Seminary, also in Atlanta, and aired on radio and TV.\n\nAccording to an obituary provided by In Touch Ministries, the program “penetrated almost every major market in the United States” during the 1980s. In the District of Columbia area, his daily radio sermons aired on WAVA and other stations.\n\nAlong with various cable and satellite networks including TBN and Daystar, Mr. Stanley’s weekly TV messages appeared around the country.\n\nGlobally, “In Touch” programs are seen and heard on over 2,600 radio and TV outlets in more than 50 languages. He sold more than 10 million copies of his 70 books. “Trusting God With Today: 365 Devotions,” his latest title, is expected to be published in October by Thomas Nelson.\n\n“Dr. Stanley leaves behind a lasting legacy as a torchbearer and trailblazer of Gospel ministry and Christian broadcasting,” said Troy A. Miller, CEO of the National Religious Broadcasters. “We were blessed to have such a faithful servant of the Lord as a veteran NRB member and a faithful supporter and encourager of the work of NRB.”\n\nMr. Stanley was inducted into the NRB’s Hall of Fame in 1988 and received the 2020 NRB Chairman’s Award.\n\nMr. Stanley’s life was not without its personal challenges, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. He separated from his wife, Anna Stanley, in the 1990s and finalized their divorce in 2000. That split caused a years-long schism between Mr. Stanley and his son, Andy, who at the time worked at a First Baptist Atlanta satellite congregation and now heads North Point Ministries in the Atlanta area. The two later reconciled.\n\nMr. Stanley is also survived by a daughter, Becky Stanley Broderson, six grandchildren, three great-grandchildren and a half-sister, Susie Cox.\n\n• Mark A.

                    "snippet": "Dr. Charles Stanley, a longtime megachurch pastor, prolific author, and pioneering evangelical broadcaster, died in his home in Atlanta Tuesday morning, First Baptist Church of Atlanta announced.\n\n\n\nDr. Stanley was 90 years old.\n\n\"In Touch Family, this morning, God called our beloved pastor, Dr. Charles Stanley, home to heaven. Dr. Stanley lived a life of obedience and is now receiving the joy of his soul—seeing his Savior face-to-face. Please join us in praying for the Stanley family,\" the ministry Dr. Stanley first launched nationwide as \"The Chapel Hour\" in 1978 tweeted Tuesday.\n\n\n\nDr. Stanley ministered as a pastor, teacher, author, and broadcaster for 65 years. He retired as First Baptist Church of Atlanta's senior pastor in 2020, after 50 years of service.\n\nResponses from the faith community and others celebrating Stanley's life quickly flooded social media.\n\n\"Our prayers are with the family of Dr. Charles Stanley, who went home to Heaven today at the age of 90. Dr. Stanley was the founder of @InTouchMin and pastored @FirstBaptistATL for 50 years. I appreciate his faithfulness in unashamedly teaching the Word of God. For many who travel, and also during Covid-19 when people couldn’t attend their own churches, Dr. Stanley’s messages on television not only inspired us but fed us spiritually,\" Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham and president of Samaritan's Purse, tweeted.\n\n\"His teaching was solid—He did not compromise on God’s Word like so many others do today. God used him to impact so many lives around the world, and he will be greatly missed. Dr. Stanley and my father @BillyGraham were together on several occasions. They’re pictured here in 1994 in Atlanta, Georgia.\"\n\n\"Dr. Charles Stanley was a great friend and encourager to me. He was always solidly biblical and extremely practical in his preaching. He will be greatly missed by all,\" said Dr. Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Dallas.\n\n\"Charles Stanley went to Heaven today. He made his mark on this world for the Gospel and his incredible teaching of God’s Word. I like so many others was blessed by hearing his messages on the radio and TV and he was a trusted voice we have all been encouraged by,\" wrote Harvest megachurch Pastor Greg Laurie.\n\n\"It was my privilege to meet Dr. Stanley in person in Charlotte, North Carolina at the funeral for Billy Graham. He was warm and gracious. No doubt, he has already heard Jesus say, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of your Lord.' Charles Stanley will be greatly missed.\"\n\n\"My prayers are with the family of Dr. Charles Stanley as the Lord called this powerful communicator of truth to his eternal reward. It was an honor to have known him. His faithfulness to the Lord has touched the lives of countless people,\" wrote Family Research Council president Tony Perkins.\n\nDr. Stanley is survived by son Andy Stanley, senior pastor at North Point Ministries, daughter Becky Stanley Broderson, six grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and a half-sister Susie Cox, according to an official obituary on his namesake website.\n\n\n\nDr. Stanley often used the phrase \"now, listen,\" or some variation of it, when delivering a portion of a sermon he was determined to drive home. He also regularly used mnemonic devices to help churchgoers remember crucial points.\n\n\"Now listen ... ,\" Dr. Stanley might begin, if he were addressing people mourning his loss today. He might then follow that with a trio of biblically-backed points encouraging them to take heart, as he was now happily face-to-face with the Savior whose message of hope he shared every chance he got for 65 years.\n\n\n\nWatch WXIA's coverage of Dr. Stanley's passing below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Blaze News?

                    "snippet": "Dr. Donald Bruce Irwin, who turned a Hoover clinic into the 30-state AFC healthcare network, died Friday at the age of 73.\n\nAccording to an announcement from American Family Care, Irwin’s death came following a sudden illness.\n\n“Dr. Irwin was a visionary leader and pioneer of accessible primary care and urgent care who dedicated his life to improving access to quality healthcare,” AFC President Randy Johansen said.\n\n“No words can express our sadness about his death or our gratitude for the opportunity to work with him. Dr. Irwin’s legacy will continue to live on through the work we do every day, and we will be diligent in carrying forward the mission of American Family Care.”\n\nFuneral services will be held Saturday at Birmingham’s Asbury United Methodist Church, with visitation beginning at 2 p.m. and services at 3 p.m.\n\nA graduate of Birmingham Southern College and the UAB School of Medicine, Irwin opened the first American Family Care in Hoover in 1982. The franchise model took off in 2013 when the company acquired, and rebranded Doctor’s Express, an urgent care franchise.\n\nHeadquartered in Birmingham, AFC now has more than 300 locations across 30 states.\n\nIn a 2011 interview with The Birmingham News, Irwin recounted how he envisioned the AFC concept from his time as an emergency room physician - for a stand-alone medical facility equipped and staffed like an ER, with extended hours and no need for appointments.\n\n“Many people were coming to the emergency room with problems which could have been cared for in a less expensive and more convenient manner,” Irwin said.\n\nIrwin said he got the inspiration to become a doctor caring for his father, who was injured on the job as a railroad worker in 1949, and needed a wheelchair for the rest of his life. A later adverse reaction by his father to penicillin resolved Irwin to head to medical school.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Carla and several children and grandchildren.",

In 2014, for example, a 43-year-old man scaled one of the fences, armed with a folding knife, and made it all the way into the White House's East Room. The man was sentenced in 2015 to 17 months in prison.

ArrowRight The incident — first reported by the Associated Press, which captured a photograph of the youngster being carried by police — occurred around 11 a.m., according to U.S. Secret Service spokesperson Lt. Paul Mayhair. Officials said that after the child squeezed through the metal fencing on the north side of the White House, officers quickly retrieved him and reunited him with his parents.\n\nMayhair said the incident would not rank among the most significant or unusual things he has seen in his 13-year career with the Secret Service. But the boy appears to be the first person to get past a new, taller fence installed outside the White House in recent years — albeit not by going over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The Secret Service Uniformed Division today encountered a curious young visitor along the White House north fence line who briefly entered White House grounds,” the Secret Service said in a statement. “The White House security systems instantly triggered Secret Service officers and the toddler and parents were quickly reunited.”\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the U.S. Secret Service, said that responding officers took care to not respond too aggressively in a way that could scare the toddler. He said the incident would be one that the toddler’s parents would not let them forget.\n\n“This might be a story around the Thanksgiving dinner table for sure,” Guglielmi said.\n\nAsked whether the agency would now babyproof the fence, Mayhair referred the question to the White House.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

                    "snippet": "Quick Take\n\nThere’s no evidence the White House aided or had prior knowledge of the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022. By law, the White House requested access for the FBI to review the classified documents that former President Donald Trump turned over seven months earlier. That doesn’t mean the White House was “involved” in the “raid” that came later and “lied” about it, as a conservative commentator claimed.\n\nFull Story\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration negotiated with representatives for former President Donald Trump throughout 2021 for the return of presidential records that should have been given to NARA when Trump left office. NARA was finally able to get back 15 boxes of materials from Trump’s team in January 2022.\n\nWhen NARA noticed hundreds of pages of classified documents in the boxes, NARA’s Office of the Inspector General on Feb. 9, 2022, referred the matter to the Department of Justice. The DOJ then launched its criminal investigation into Trump’s handling of the documents, which were taken to Mar-a-Lago – his private club and residence in Palm Beach, Florida — when Trump’s presidency ended.\n\nSo that the FBI and other intelligence officials could review the boxes of documents that were transferred to NARA’s custody, the DOJ, as authorized by federal law, asked the White House to submit a “special access request” to NARA, the official custodian of presidential records. NARA said the White House submitted the request in April 2022 and access was subsequently granted to the FBI by NARA’s acting archivist.\n\nThe request for access to those particular documents doesn’t have anything to do with other classified documents that were later seized from Trump’s Florida estate on Aug. 8, 2022, when the FBI executed a search warrant that was obtained from a federal judge. FBI officials sought the warrant after Trump and his representatives failed to return additional classified documents and presidential records that were still at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMarine One leaves Mar-a-Lago on March 29, 2019. White House photo by Joyce N. Boghosian.\n\nHowever, some conservative commentators and groups have falsely claimed or suggested that recently obtained communications discussing the access request from last spring show that the White House was directly involved in, or had prior knowledge of, the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago last summer.\n\n“It appears the White House used this special access request, where the White House says, ‘Hey, we need to get access to the prior administration’s stuff to make a decision now.’ They pulled that stunt to get this Mar-a-Lago raid … so that they could go in there,” Dan Bongino, a conservative political commentator, said in a video posted to his website’s Facebook page on April 12.\n\nBongino, whose Facebook video had received roughly 99,000 views as of April 18, based his claim on information obtained by the conservative group America First Legal. He said the information “reveals that the Biden White House was involved with the Mar-a-Lago raid, and that the NARA, the National Archives, misled Congress” about its own participation.\n\nAmerica First Legal, which was started by former Trump White House advisers, made the same claim in the headline of an April 10 press release about emails and other records it recently procured from NARA through a request under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nBut the FOIA documents do not show that the White House was behind the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago last year, or that President Joe Biden and other White House officials were “lying” about not having advance notice that Trump’s home would be searched, as Bongino and others also claimed.\n\nThe Press Release\n\nAmerica First Legal’s press release highlighted an Aug. 23, 2022, email it obtained from NARA. In the email, NARA’s general counsel, Gary Stern, informed his NARA colleagues that the Washington Post had published a story mentioning an email he sent to Trump’s representatives about a “special access request for the 15 Trump boxes” months earlier.\n\n“On April 12, an Archives official emailed [former White House deputy counsel Pat] Philbin and John Eisenberg, another former deputy White House counsel, to tell them the Justice Department, via the Biden White House, had made the request,” the Post’s Aug. 23 story said. “The email offered the lawyers the opportunity to view the documents as well, but said the documents were too sensitive to be removed from the agency’s secure facility.”\n\nIn its press release, America First Legal went on to say, “It appears that the Biden White House and DOJ coordinated to obtain the Trump records and perhaps create a pretext for the law enforcement raid by way of a ‘special access request.’”\n\nBut as we said, the White House’s request for access was about allowing the FBI to review the 15 boxes of documents that NARA took possession of in January 2022 – not any classified documents that would later be recovered from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe ‘Special Access Request’\n\nOnce NARA discovered the boxes contained classified national security information, its Office of the Inspector General notified the Justice Department, which launched a criminal investigation.\n\nThe DOJ then asked the Biden White House to request that NARA provide the FBI with access to the boxes. That’s because, under the Presidential Records Act of 1978, executive branch departments and agencies, under certain conditions, can request special access to records in NARA custody through the sitting president, not through NARA.\n\nThe Presidential Records Act is the same federal law that says presidential records are the property of the government and requires the archivist of the U.S. to take custody of all such records when a president leaves office.\n\nThe White House, through its counsel’s office, formally asked NARA on April 11, 2022, to “provide the FBI access to the 15 boxes” that came from Mar-a-Lago, according to Debra Steidel Wall, the acting archivist. The following day, NARA informed Trump’s representatives that the agency would be making the documents available during the week of April 18, 2022.\n\nBut Trump’s team then proceeded to block the FBI from gaining access by requesting extensions to review the documents to determine if any were covered by executive privilege.\n\nOn April 29, 2022, the DOJ’s national security division explained to Trump’s representatives why it needed access to the documents.\n\n“There are important national security interests in the FBI and others in the Intelligence Community getting access to these materials,” the DOJ’s national security division told the Trump team.\n\nThe national security division added: “According to NARA, among the materials in the boxes are over 100 documents with classification markings, comprising more than 700 pages. Some include the highest levels of classification, including Special Access Program (SAP) materials. Access to the materials is not only necessary for purposes of our ongoing criminal investigation, but the Executive Branch must also conduct an assessment of the potential damage resulting from the apparent manner in which these materials were stored and transported and take any necessary remedial steps.”\n\nFinally, on May 10, Steidel Wall wrote to Evan Corcoran, one of Trump’s representatives, and said that Biden, given Trump’s executive privilege claims, had deferred a final ruling on the matter to her. Steidel Wall then explained that, after consulting with the assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, she determined there was no reason to further delay granting access to the FBI, rejecting the former president’s assertion of executive privilege.\n\nShe informed Corcoran that the FBI would be able to review the boxes within days.\n\nAmerica First Legal has argued that the special access request may have been used illegally in this case.\n\n“The special access statute authorizes special access requests to an incumbent president only when the records in question are needed for ‘the conduct of current business’ of the White House,” its press release said. “Providing documents to the DOJ for purposes of a criminal investigation is not the ‘current business’ of the White House.”\n\nIn addition, Bongino’s video featured a clip of Jeff Clark, director of litigation for the conservative Center for Renewing America, who argued that the DOJ should have requested access to the documents via a subpoena, which is another option for gaining special access to presidential records.\n\nHowever, in her letter, Steidel Wall said that the conditions for granting access via a request from the White House were “satisfied here” because, as the DOJ’s security division explained to Trump’s team, access also was necessary to “conduct an assessment of the potential damage” to national security “and take any necessary remedial steps.”\n\nWhen they examined the contents in mid-May, FBI agents identified “184 unique documents bearing classification markings, including 67 documents marked as CONFIDENTIAL, 92 documents marked as SECRET, and 25 documents marked as TOP SECRET.”\n\nSteidel Wall’s letter detailing the access request is not new information, as some have suggested. For example, the Bongino Report’s Facebook post had the headline: “EXPLOSIVE FOIA Request Exposes Biden Lie About Mar-a-Lago Raid.”\n\nThe request for FBI access has been public information for more than seven months.\n\nJohn Solomon, a conservative writer and another one of Trump’s representatives to NARA, obtained the text of Steidel Wall’s letter and published it on his Just The News website on Aug. 22, 2022. NARA published the letter on its own website the next day, and the letter received press coverage at the time — including the Washington Post story mentioned in the email that America First Legal featured in its press release.\n\nThe Search of Mar-a-Lago\n\nFurthermore, the White House’s request also was not the reason the Justice Department launched its investigation of Trump that led to the FBI searching Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“Until the White House did this, this was an administrative dispute between the Archives and Trump,” Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a conservative nonprofit organization, said in an April 12 interview with Glenn Beck. A clip of the exchange between Fitton and Beck has been viewed about 32,000 times on Facebook and over 49,000 times on Twitter.\n\n“The Biden White House intervened to allow a criminal investigation of Trump by the Justice Department. It wouldn’t have happened but for White House intervention,” Fitton said.\n\nBut the access request came after the DOJ’s investigation had already begun.\n\nThat was made clear in the affidavit that the FBI filed to convince a federal judge to issue the warrant that allowed agents to search Trump’s property. A redacted version of the affidavit, which was unsealed weeks after the search, says:\n\nFBI affidavit, Aug. 5, 2022: After an initial review of the NARA Referral, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened a criminal investigation to, among other things, determine how the documents with classification markings and records were removed from the White House (or any other authorized location(s) for the storage of classified materials) and came to be stored at the PREMISES; determine whether the storage location(s) at the PREMISES were authorized locations for the storage of classified information; determine whether any additional classified documents or records may have been stored in an unauthorized location at the PREMISES or another unknown location, and whether they remain at any such location; and identify any person(s) who may have removed or retained classified information without authorization and/or in an unauthorized space.\n\nIn fact, on May 11, 2022, as part of the FBI’s investigation, Trump’s office received a separate grand jury subpoena for additional classified records that the government believed were still stored at Trump’s Florida residence. That happened before the FBI was finally able to review the first 15 boxes of documents about a week later.\n\nAfter requesting and being granted additional time to comply with the subpoena, a lawyer for Trump met with a DOJ lawyer and FBI agents who traveled to Mar-a-Lago on June 3. Trump’s representatives gave the officials an envelope containing dozens of additional classified documents that were found by Trump’s team in a storage room.\n\nAccording to a DOJ court filing, Trump’s representatives, in a certification letter, told the agents that a “diligent search was conducted” for “all documents that are responsive to the subpoena.” Counsel for Trump also told the agents “there were no other records stored in any private office space or other location” inside Mar-a-Lago, the DOJ recounted in the court filing.\n\nFollowing the meeting, however, government authorities “developed evidence” that more classified documents remained at the Florida property, according to a subsequent DOJ court filing. The FBI eventually requested the warrant to conduct its own search, and the search warrant was signed and approved by a federal judge in Florida on Aug. 5.\n\nAccording to the redacted affidavit, the FBI argued there was probable cause to believe classified documents and other presidential records remained at Mar-a-Lago, and that a search would yield evidence of multiple crimes, including obstruction.\n\nFBI agents executed the search warrant on Aug. 8, seizing 13 additional boxes that “contained documents with classification markings, and in all, over one hundred unique documents with classification markings … more than twice the amount produced on June 3, 2022, in response to the grand jury subpoena,” according to another DOJ court filing.\n\nWhite House Denials\n\nOn Aug. 9, the day after the FBI’s search, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a press briefing that White House officials learned of the search from news reports and that “no one at the White House was given a heads up,” including the president. “No, that did not happen,” she said.\n\nBiden later said himself that he did not have advance notice of the FBI’s plans. “None. Zero. Not one single bit,” he said while taking questions from White House reporters on Aug. 25.\n\nBut in the video from his show, Bongino said the information America First Legal got through a FOIA request showed that Jean-Pierre and the White House were caught “lying” about being “stunned by the “Mar-a-Lago raid.”\n\nThat information is not evidence that the White House knew the FBI search was going to happen.\n\nAs Jean-Pierre said in an Aug. 29, 2022, press briefing, the access request for the FBI, which was mentioned in Steidel Wall’s letter and Stern’s email, is “completely different” from the search that happened later.\n\nThe request was for the review of a separate set of documents than those recovered from Mar-a-Lago by FBI agents in August, and the request came after the Justice Department had already opened its criminal investigation into Trump’s handling of presidential records after leaving office.\n\nNone of that means the White House used the special access request “to get this Mar-a-Lago raid,” as Bongino said, or that the FBI search “wouldn’t have happened” otherwise, as Fitton claimed. The FBI was merely following the law when it requested special access to records in NARA custody through the White House.\n\nOther fact-checkers have previously written about similar false social media claims.\n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

In response, the sheriff is threatening to prosecute the newspaper that exposed his racism.\n\nThe recording, published by the family-owned paper, captured a candid conversation on March 6 between Sheriff Clardy, investigator Alicia Manning, and district commissioner Mark Jennings following a county Board of Commissioners meeting. The recording was made by McCurtain Gazette-News publisher Bruce Willingham, who told the Associated Press that he’d left the device in the room, because he believed the group was conducting official business after the meeting ended — a violation of state law.\n\nAs it happened, Willingham’s son Chris, a reporter at the family-owned newspaper, had filed a defamation suit against Manning on March 6:\n\nSo what led up to McCurtain Co. officials allegedly plotting to kill Gazette journalists in an audio recording? Reporter Chris Willingham filed a defamation lawsuit that details events leading up to the recording. The suit was filed the same day as the recorded meeting.

Jennings said he already had holes for both Bruce and Chris Willingham that were “pre-dug” and mentioned a hit man he knew who would “cut no fucking mercy.”\n\nThe three moved on to a conversation about how many candidates would run in the upcoming race for county sheriff. “They don’t have a goddamn clue what they’re getting into,” Jennings said. “Not this day and age. I’m gonna tell you something. If it was back in the day, when Alan Marston would take a damn Black guy and whoop their ass and throw him in the cell? I’d run for fucking sheriff.” Jennings was referring to the county sheriff who served in the 1980s.\n\n“Yeah,” Clardy replied in the recording. “It’s not like that no more.”\n\n“I know,” said Jennings. “Take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a damn rope. But you can’t do that anymore. They got more rights than we got.”’\n\nFBI is now investigating case of the McCurtain County Oklahoma sheriff, county officials who were CAUGHT on a RECORDING discussing killing a newspaper reporter and talking about returning to Black hangings. pic.twitter.com/078jcGOsfc — Popitics (@Popitics1) April 18, 2023\n\nMany local officials would resign with such a sordid tape making national news, but the sheriff’s office published a statement on Monday describing the “complex situation” it was facing and alleging that the recording may have been doctored. The office promised additional press releases as “findings are forwarded to the appropriate authorities for felony charges to be filed on those involved.”\n\nAlthough Clardy refuses to back down, there is a growing coalition calling for his resignation. On Monday, more than 100 people gathered at the county courthouse calling for him to resign. Republican figures, from the state representative encompassing McCurtain County to the governor, have called for the resignation of Clardy, Manning, Jennings, and jail administrator Larry Hendrix, who was present for the conversation.",

The suspension does not remove them from their jobs with the sheriff’s department.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt called for the trio's resignations Monday and for County Commissioner Mark Jennings to step down, as well.\n\nThe McCurtain County Gazette-News identified the four as the officials who were recorded March 6 making threatening and racist statements after a meeting of the McCurtain County Commission.\n\nNone have spoken publicly about the scandal engulfing the county. On Monday the sheriff’s office claimed that the recording had been “illegally obtained,” appeared to have been altered and may have violated a state law prohibiting secret recordings by third parties.\n\nResidents call for the resignations of several McCurtain County officials at a county commissioners meeting Monday in Idabel, Okla. Christopher Bryan / Southwest Ledger via AP\n\nChristin Jones, of the law firm Kilpatrick Townsend, which represents the newspaper, insisted the recording had not been tampered with and that reporter Bruce Willingham, whose family has owned the newspaper for 40 years, did not break the law in making it.\n\n“It is an accurate recording and does not violate the Oklahoma Security of Communications Act,” Jones said by email. “The full audio is planned to be released on Thursday.”\n\nThe entire recording has already been turned over to the FBI and the Oklahoma attorney general’s office, the law firm has said.\n\nDozens of picketers descended Monday on the headquarters of the McCurtain County Commissioners in the town of Idabel to demand the ousters of Clardy and the others following publication of the newspaper article.\n\nOn Tuesday, McCurtain Memorial Hospital in Idabel was evacuated after it got a bomb threat a little after 2 p.m. ET. It was not immediately clear whether it was related to the protests.\n\n\"The bomb threat was real, and the evacuation is real,\" an Idabel police dispatcher said. \"But we don't know yet if the bomb is real, and we have a bomb squad there right now.\"\n\nThe hospital said in a statement confirming the threat that \"a demand was made or else, the bomb would be detonated.\" It did not elaborate further.\n\nEarlier, hundreds of critics went to Clardy's official Facebook page and blasted the sheriff’s office for suggesting Willingham had done something wrong.\n\n\"Absolute scum of the Earth,\" Christian Sage Walker wrote. \"You got caught on tape talking about lynching black people and hanging journalists and now you want sympathy.\"\n\nAnother poster, Jay Stiles, mocked the sheriff's response.\n\n\"When you’re caught making fun of an arson victim, lamenting that you can’t lynch people and talking about hiring hitmen to take out a journalist ... and this is your response ... ,\" Stiles wrote. \"Classy move McCurtain County Sheriff's Office.\"\n\nAside from the Facebook posting by the sheriff’s office, none of the embattled McCurtain County officials have commented on the scandal sweeping through Idabel and have not responded to emails and calls seeking comment. Willingham has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe drama began after Willingham, acting on a tip that the commissioners were illegally engaging in county business after the public meetings were over, left a recording device in the commissioners’ chamber, the newspaper reported.\n\nEarlier that day, Willingham’s son, Christopher Lee Willingham, who is also a reporter at the newspaper, had sued Clardy, Manning and the commissioners in U.S. District Court for Eastern Oklahoma seeking unspecified damages. He claimed they were punishing him for his hard-hitting reporting by spreading “slander” about him.\n\nWhen Willingham retrieved the device, he discovered that the conversation began with a grisly conversation about a fire victim being compared to “barbecue” before the group turned to talking about his son and hiring hitmen from the Louisiana mafia to take him out.\n\nPerhaps the most explosive part of the recording came when the talk turned to who might run against Clardy in the coming election and Jennings recalled how a former sheriff “would take a damned Black guy and whoop their ass and throw them in the cell,” the newspaper reported.\n\n“Yeah,” Clardy replied, according to the newspaper. “It’s not like that no more.”\n\n“I know,” Jennings said. “Take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a damned rope. But you can’t do that anymore. They’ve got more rights than we’ve got.”",

Not this day and age.\n\n'I'm gonna tell you something. If it was back in the day, when that Alan Marshton would take a damn black guy and whoop their ass and throw him in the cell? I'd run for f****** sheriff.'\n\nHe went on: 'Take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a d**n rope. But you can't do that anymore.

Jennings: It's like somebody wanting this job, they don't realize, like your job. I heard it the other day, said I heard 2 or 12 people were going for sheriff. I said fuck, lets get 20. They don't have a goddamn clue what they're getting into. Not this day and age. I'm gonna tell you something. If it was back in the day, when that -- when Alan Marshton would take a damn black guy and whoop their ass and throw him in the cell? I'd run for fucking sheriff. Sheriff: Yeah. Well, It's not like that no more. Jennings: I know. Take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a damn rope. But you can't do that anymore. They got more rights than we got.

'I was shocked as I assume most people were not only about the comments about journalists, but the racist comments regarding African Americans. Joking doesn´t excuse that.'\n\nSenat said under Oklahoma law, the recording would be legal if it were obtained in a place where the officials being recorded did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nMcCurtain County is in far southeast Oklahoma, bordering both Arkansas and Texas, in a part of the state often referred to as 'Little Dixie,' because of the influence in the area from white Southerners who migrated there after the Civil War.\n\nWith its rolling, forested hills in the foothills of the Ouachita Mountains, the area has become a tourism hotbed attracting a steady stream of visitors from the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nState Rep. Eddy Dempsey, a Republican who represents the area in the Oklahoma House, said the recorded comments don't reflect the values of his constituents and echoed Stitt's call for the four people involved in the conversation to resign.\n\n'All my life, we've always said we don't get enough recognition in southeast Oklahoma,' Dempsey said. 'But we don't need this kind of recognition.'",

(AP)\n\nNone of the four officials named by Stitt could be reached for comment, but late Monday the McCurtain County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that the recording was \"illegally obtained,\" appears to have been altered, and may have been produced in violation of state law prohibiting secret recordings by third parties.\n\nThe office, which said it has received threats of violence and death over the saga, said it was investigating how the recording was obtained and whether it violated the secret recording law.\n\nInvestigative findings, the sheriff's office said, will be \"forwarded to the appropriate authorities for felony charges to be filed on those involved.\"\n\nThe Willinghams also did not respond to inquiries from NBC News. But Kilpatrick Townsend, the law firm representing the Willingham family, said they appreciated the expressions of support.\n\n\"For nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain County,\" the statement said.\n\nFor nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain County.Law firm Kilpatrick Townsend\n\nThe latest furor erupted after Willingham, acting on a tip that the commissioners were illegally engaging in county business after the public meetings were over, left a recording device on March 6 in the commissioners' chamber, the newspaper reported.\n\nEarlier that day, Willingham's son, Christopher Lee Willingham, who is also a reporter at the newspaper, had filed a lawsuit against Clardy, Manning and the commissioners in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma seeking unspecified damages. He claimed they were punishing him for his hard-hitting reporting by spreading \"slander\" about him.\n\nWhen Willingham retrieved the device, he discovered that the conversation began with a grisly conversation about a fire victim being compared to \"barbecue\" before the group turned to talking about his son.\n\n\"My papaw would have whipped his ass, would have wiped him and used him for toilet paper,\" Manning said of the younger Willingham, according to the newspaper. \"If my daddy hadn't been run over by a vehicle, he would have been down there.\"\n\nJennings then piped in, saying \"I know where two big, deep holes are here if you ever need them.\"\n\n\"I've got an excavator,\" Clardy chimed in, according to the newspaper.\n\nJennings, according to the newspaper, then said he knew \"two or three hit men\" who belong to the Louisiana mafia.\n\n\"They're very quiet guys and would cut no f—ing mercy,\" he reportedly said.\n\nManning, according to the newspaper, discussed \"who would get the blame if anything was done\" to Christopher Lee Willingham's wife, Angie.\n\nThere was also \"caustic\" criticism of local District Attorney Mark Matloff, the newspaper reported in the first batch of recordings it released.\n\nSome of the discussion included not only harsh criticism of judges, but also the possibility of assaults on judges here.Newspaper report\n\nMatloff is not commenting on the report, a member of his staff said at the McCurtain County Courthouse.\n\n\"Some of the discussion included not only harsh criticism of judges, but also the possibility of assaults on judges here,\" the newspaper reported.\n\nWhen the talk turned to who might run for sheriff against Clardy, Jenning recalled how a former sheriff \"would take a damned Black guy and whoop their ass and throw them in the cell.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Clardy replied, according to the newspaper. \"It's not like that no more.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Jennings. \"Take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a damned rope. But you can't do that anymore. They've got more rights than we've got.\"\n\nTwo more batches of recordings made by Willingham are to be released soon, his lawyers said.\n\nThe Willingham family has lived in the county for 120 years and has operated The McCurtain County Gazette-News for 40 years. Founded in 1905, it is a print-only publication, a rarity in the rapidly diminishing world of newspapers. And this is not the first time it has made national news.\n\nIn the wake of the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, Willingham hired a freelancer named J.D. Cash who produced a number of scoops about the investigation into the deadly terror attack and who was later derided as a \"conspiracy theorist\" by some of the newspaper's competitors. Cash died in 2007.",

                    "snippet": "A sheriff and several officials of a rural Oklahoma county are under pressure to resign after a local newspaper recorded their racist and expletive-laden conversation about their desire to murder journalists and lynch Black citizens.\n\nDozens of residents of McCurtain county protested at the sheriff’s office in Idabel on Monday, echoing calls from the Oklahoma governor, Kevin Stitt, and the city’s mayor, Craig Young, for the officials to step down.\n\nIn the recording, captured after a county commission meeting in March, and released by the McCurtain Gazette, Sheriff Kevin Clardy is heard discussing with commissioner Mark Jennings, investigator Alicia Manning and jail administrator Larry Hendrix, the hiring of “mafia hitmen” one of them claimed to know to kill the newspaper’s owners and journalists.\n\nThe hitmen would, according to Jennings, “cut no fucking mercy” while Clardy offered the use of his excavator to dig graves.\n\nBut it was the group’s deeply racist commentary that angered protesters the most. Jennings cited a former county sheriff from the 1980s in a discussion about running for the office. “If it was back in the day, when Alan Marston would take a damn Black guy and whoop their ass and throw him in the cell, I’d run for fucking sheriff,” he said on the recording.\n\n“Yeah, it’s not like that no more,” Clardy lamented, before Jennings continued: “Take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a damn rope. But you can’t do that any more. They got more rights than we got.”\n\nIn another snippet, the group is heard mocking a woman who died in a fire – the sheriff likened her corpse to barbecued meat.\n\nStitt issued a statement demanding the “immediate resignation” of the four.\n\n“I am both appalled and disheartened to hear of the horrid comments made by officials in McCurtain county,” Stitt said. “There is simply no place for such hateful rhetoric in the state of Oklahoma, especially by those that serve to represent the community through their respective office. I will not stand idly by while this takes place.”\n\nStitt added he had ordered the state bureau of investigation to determine “whether any illegal conduct has occurred”.\n\nThe recording was made by the Gazette after a commission meeting in Idabel in March. According to NBC News, the outlet suspected that officials were illegally conducting county business outside a public meeting and left an active recording device in the council chamber.\n\nIn a statement to NBC, Kilpatrick Townsend, the law firm representing the Willingham family that owns the Gazette, said its clients had previously been targeted by county officials who disliked its reporting.\n\n“For nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain county,” the statement said.\n\nClardy, Manning and Hendrix were reportedly suspended from the Oklahoma Sheriffs’ Association on Tuesday, according to a statement given to local media.\n\nThe McCurtain county sheriff’s office, meanwhile, promised its own criminal investigation into how the recording was made and released.\n\nA statement posted to Facebook by the department alleges “multiple, significant violations” of an Oklahoma state communications law and threatens felony charges “for those involved”.\n\n“Many of these recordings, like the one published by media outlets on Friday, have yet to be duly authenticated or validated. Our preliminary information indicates that the media released audio recording has, in fact, been altered. The motivation for doing so remains unclear at this point,” it said.\n\n“In addition to being illegally obtained, the audio does not match the ‘transcription’ of that audio and is not precisely consistent with what has been put into print.”\n\nThe sheriff’s office also said death threats had been made to county officials and their families, and claimed “multiple agencies” were assisting its investigation.",

                    "snippet": "Horrifying audio released by The McCurtain Gazette-News\n\nAn Oklahoma sheriff, one of his investigators and a county commissioner can be heard discussing killing a local reporter and moaning about not being able to lynch black people in horrifying audio released by a county newspaper. The explosive accusations were published this week in the McCurtain Gazette-News, and now the state’s governor is calling for resignations in connection to the claims. McCurtain County Sheriff Kevin Clardy, county Commissioner Mark Jennings, sheriff’s investigator Alicia Manning, and Jail Administrator Larry Hendrix have been asked to step down as they appear to discuss killing reporters Bruce and Chris Willingham, whose family has run the paper for decades, in the released tape.\n\nPeople from Oklahoma calling for the resignation of the accused officials at a meeting on Monday\n\nAccording to the paper, Jennings tells Clardy and Manning: “I know where two deep holes are dug if you ever need them. And the sheriff responded: “I’ve got an excavator.” The Commissioner also allegedly says he knows “two or three hit men” in Louisiana, adding, “they’re very quiet guys” and would “cut no f****** mercy”. Manning adds that she was “worried about what I might do to him”, referring to Chris Willingham, as she prepared to travel to the men’s newspaper office. She goes on to say how her father would have “whipped his ass, would have wiped him and used him for toilet paper,” and “started to go down there and just kill him.” In another vile exchange, the group discusses people applying for the role of Sheriff and how they thought the job had changed. Jennings allegedly said: “They don’t have a goddamn clue what they’re getting into. Not in this day and age. “I’m gonna tell you something. If it was back in the day, when that Alan Marshton would take a damn black guy and whoop their ass and throw him in the cell? I’d run for f****** sheriff.”\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt speaking during a roundtable at the White House in 2020\n\nHe continued: “Take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a damn rope. But you can’t do that anymore. They got more rights than we got.” Further audio appears to show the Sheriff and Jail Administrator comparing the victim of a house fire to meat on a “barbecue”. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said on Sunday that he is seeking the resignations of Clardy, Manning and Jennings, as well as Hendrix. Stitt said in a statement: “I am both appalled and disheartened to hear of the horrid comments made by officials in McCurtain County. There is simply no place for such hateful rhetoric in the state of Oklahoma, especially by those that serve to represent the community through their respective office.” He said he has ordered the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation to “initiate an investigation to determine whether any illegal conduct has occurred.” Bruce Willingham said he has also turned over his audio recordings to the FBI and the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office and added he has had several conversations with federal investigators.\n\nTrending\n\nAngry residents gathered for the McCurtain County protest",

                    "snippet": "CNN —\n\nThe governor of Oklahoma is calling on four McCurtain County officials to resign after they allegedly participated in a secretly recorded conversation that included racist remarks about lynching Black people and talking about killing journalists.\n\nThe McCurtain Gazette-News over the weekend published the audio it said was recorded following a Board of Commissioners meeting on March 6.\n\nThe paper said the audio of the meeting was legally obtained, but the McCurtain County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that it was illegally recorded and is investigating. The sheriff’s office also said it believes the recording had been altered.\n\n“I am both appalled and disheartened to hear of the horrid comments made by officials in McCurtain County,” Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement Sunday. “There is simply no place for such hateful rhetoric in the state of Oklahoma, especially by those that serve to represent the community through their respective office. I will not stand idly by while this takes place,” the statement said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt. Phelan M. Ebenhack/AP\n\nThe governor called for the immediate resignations of McCurtain County Sheriff Kevin Clardy, District 2 Commissioner Mark Jennings, sheriff’s investigator Alicia Manning and jail administrator Larry Hendrix. He also said he would ask the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation to look into the case.\n\nMcCurtain County is in southeastern Oklahoma, about 200 miles from Oklahoma City.\n\nThe recording was made hours after Gazette-News reporter Chris Willingham filed a lawsuit against the sheriff’s office, Manning and the Board of County Commissioners, alleging they had defamed him and violated his civil rights, the newspaper reported.\n\nIn the recording, Manning spoke of needing to go near the newspaper’s office and expressed concern about what would happen if she ran into Willingham, the Oklahoman reported, citing additional reporting from the Gazette-News.\n\nAccording to the Oklahoman report, Jennings said, “Oh, you’re talking about you can’t control yourself?” and Manning replied: “Yeah, I ain’t worried about what he’s gonna do to me. I’m worried about what I might do to him. My papaw would have whipped his a**, would have wiped him and used him for toilet paper … if my daddy hadn’t been run over by a vehicle, he would have been down there.”\n\nJennings replied that his father was once upset by something the newspaper published and “started to go down there and just kill him,” according to the Gazette-News.\n\n“I know where two big, deep holes are here if you ever need them,” Jennings allegedly said. Clardy, the sheriff, allegedly said he had the equipment.\n\n“I’ve got an excavator,” Clardy is accused of saying during the discussion. “Well, these are already pre-dug,” Jennings allegedly said.\n\nIn other parts of the recording, officials expressed disappointment that Black people could no longer be lynched, according to the paper.\n\nCNN has not been able to verify the authenticity of the recording or confirm who said what. CNN has reached out to all four county officials for comment.\n\nThe Oklahoma Sheriffs’ Association voted Tuesday to suspend the membership of Clardy, Manning and Hendrix, the group’s executive director told CNN.\n\nState and local agencies investigating\n\nWillingham and his father, Bruce Willingham, the paper’s publisher, have been advised to temporarily leave town, CNN affiliate KJRH reported.\n\n“For nearly a year, they have suffered intimidation, ridicule and harassment based solely on their efforts to report the news for McCurtain County,” Kilpatrick Townsend, the law firm representing the Willingham family, told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe McCurtain County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Monday that there is an “ongoing investigation into multiple significant violations” of the Oklahoma Security of Communications Act, which makes it “illegal to secretly record a conversation in which you are not involved and do not have the consent of at least one of the involved parties.” It also said the recording has yet to be “duly authenticated or validated.”\n\n“Our preliminary information indicates that the media released audio recording has, in fact, been altered. The motivation for doing so remains unclear at this point. That matter is actively being investigated,” the statement said.\n\nThe Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office has received an audio recording and is investigating, Communications Director Phil Bacharach said.\n\nThe FBI wouldn’t confirm or deny whether it was involved in the investigation, with spokesperson Kayla McCleery saying it is agency policy not to comment.",

But you can't do that anymore. They got more rights than we got,\" Jennings added.\n\nThe governor called for the resignations of Clardy, Jennings, Manning and Hendrix.\n\nLeslie Berger, press secretary for the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office, told NPR in an email that the office was investigating \"the situation in McCurtain County.\"\n\nA message sent to Jennings' district email address was not immediately returned. NPR also left a message with the McCurtain County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe Oklahoma Sheriffs' Association, a membership group that provides training and support, said on Tuesday that its board had voted to suspend Clardy, Manning and Hendrix from the association.\n\nThe sheriff's office said the recordings were illegal and may have been altered\n\nOn Monday, the sheriff's office posted a lengthy statement to Facebook in which it said the recordings were obtained illegally and may have been altered.\n\n\"In addition to being illegally obtained, the audio does not match the 'transcription' of that audio, and is not precisely consistent with what has been put into print,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nFelony charges may be filed in the case, the sheriff's office added.\n\nA McCurtain County Commission meeting on Monday morning was attended by dozens of protesters, including Idabel Mayor Craig Young, KOSU reported. Idabel, which is located nearly 200 miles southeast of Oklahoma City, is the seat of McCurtain County.\n\nYoung and others called for the resignations of officials who were heard speaking on the recordings.\n\n\"Listen, the story that you guys heard, it does not represent McCurtain County. We have good folks in McCurtain County. If we were so racist, it would not be such a diverse group here,\" Young said, according to KOSU.\n\n\"Somebody made a mistake. We're here to ask that they pay for they mistake,\" he added.",

I’d run for f***ing sheriff.”\n\nAlan Marshton, incidentally, was Sheriff in the early 1980s, according to this old state roster (PDF) of county government officials.\n\nThe sheriff agrees, but says, “It’s not like that no more,” and Jennings continues, suggesting:\n\n“Take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a damn rope. But you can’t do that anymore. They got more rights than we got.”\n\nAccording to the Heartland Signal, the news first broke in the print-only paper McCurtain Gazette-News, and the full recording is to be released at a later time.\n\nOklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, a Republican, is calling for the resignation of Clardy, Jennings, Manning, and jail administrator Larry Hendrix over their roles in the conversation, Arkansas Online reports. The FBI is also investigating.\n\nInstead of backing down, Sheriff Clardy is doubling down, though.\n\nIn a Facebook post, he alleged that the recording was the illegal part, rather than the unprofessional, racist, and potentially criminally murderous musings amongst elected officials, and said felony charges will be forthcoming. He also claims the recording has been altered.\n\n“[I]t is illegal to secretly record a conversation in which you are not involved and do not have the consent of at least one of the involved parties…In addition to being illegally obtained, the audio does not match the “transcription” of that audio, and is not precisely consistent with what has been put into print…There will be continued press releases from this agency as the investigation comes to a close and findings are forwarded to the appropriate authorities for felony charges to be filed on those involved.”\n\nAt this time it is not clear who recorded the audio, and whether it was one of the participants in the conversation, or how the paper obtained the content.\n\nListen to the audio below, then scroll for a screenshot of the McCurtain County Sheriff’s Facebook post.\n\nOn secretly recorded audio first reported by the McCurtain Gazette-News, GOP McCurtain County, Okla. officials — including the sheriff — talk about hiring hitmen to assassinate local journalists and complain that Black people now have the right to not be lynched. pic.twitter.com/N8XKNwpgqW — Heartland Signal (@HeartlandSignal) April 17, 2023\n\nThe Occupy Democrats Election Fund is a political organization\n\nthat supports ONLY good Democratic candidates Please consider supporting the fund.

Kevin Stitt (R) is calling on several local officials to resign after they were caught on audio purportedly discussing plans to kill a journalist and reminiscing on the days when black people were lynched.\n\nOver the weekend, the McCurtain Gazette-News disclosed a secret recording that caught multiple McCurtain County officials comparing a charred human body to barbecue, praising the time in history when black people were lynched, and apparently discussing hit men and killing Chris Willingham, a reporter for the Gazette-News.\n\nThe voices on the captured audio include McCurtain County Sheriff Kevin Clardy, Commissioner Mark Jennings, sheriff's investigator Alicia Manning, and jail administrator Larry Hendrix.\n\nAudio reportedly reveals McCurtain County sheriff, commissioner discussing plans to kill reporter www.youtube.com\n\nA transcript of the conversation shows Clardy, Jennings, and Manning discussing Willingham. Jennings tells Manning that he knows \"where two big deep holes are here if you ever need them,\" while Clardy assures Manning that he has an excavator. Jennings then says he knows \"two or three hit men\" who \"would cut no f***ing mercy.\"\n\nIn another portion of audio, Jennings says he would run for sheriff if he could act like Alan Marston — who served as McCurtain County sheriff in the 1980s — because allegedly Marston \"would take a damn black guy and whoop their ass and throw him in the cell. ... Take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a damn rope. But you can’t do that any more. They got more rights than we got.\"\n\nThe audio was recorded without the group's knowledge. It was captured on the same day that Willingham filed a defamation lawsuit against the sheriff's office, the Board of County Commissioners, and Manning, according to the Oklahoman.\n\nBruce Willingham, the father of Chris Willingham and the person responsible for the recording, told KWTV-DT that is he not sure how the officials could have been joking.\n\n\"I can see where they might try to [spin] that as being a joke, that part, but then Alicia comes back later on and starts talking about my daughter-in-law, and she starts getting worried about who would get the blame. I don't see how you spin that as a joke,\" Willingham said.\n\nWhat did Stitt say?\n\nHe called on Clardy, Jennings, Manning, and Hendrix to resign immediately.\n\n\"I am both appalled and disheartened to hear of the horrid comments made by officials in McCurtain County,\" he said in a statement. \"There is simply no place for such hateful rhetoric in the state of Oklahoma, especially by those that serve to represent the community through their respective office. I will not stand idly by while this takes place.\"\n\nStitt also said he has referred the matter to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. The FBI is also reportedly investigating.\n\nAnything else?\n\nThe officials involved in the scandal are not publicly responding.\n\nBut the McCurtain County Sheriffs Office released a statement on Monday indicating that the sheriff is going on the offensive.\n\nThe statement said the audio was \"illegally obtained\" because none of the involved parties had provided consent, which is required by Oklahoma law, and that county investigators are seeking to file felony charges against the person who captured the recording. The statement also claimed the audio had been \"altered,\" but did not say how.\n\nAnd while the statement claims the transcription does not exactly match the audio (and it does not explain how the sheriff's office would know that), the statement does directly deny the allegations.\n\nMcCurtain County community, Idabel mayor demand resignations of county officials www.youtube.com\n\nLike Blaze News?

Trump to be the Republican nominee — setting up a potential rematch with President Biden — some have voiced their support for one of his potential challengers: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nRep. Laurel Lee, R-Fla., has become the latest to back DeSantis, announcing on Tuesday that she was throwing her support behind the potential candidate.\n\n\"As Ron DeSantis’s Secretary of State, I had the honor of witnessing firsthand his unparalleled leadership under pressure, his character, and his commitment to core conservative principles. His leadership and his vision made Florida a shining beacon of freedom,\" Lee said in a statement. \"Ron DeSantis fights for what matters, and he wins when it matters most.\"\n\nShe added: \"Our country is in crisis, and it is time Americans learn what Floridians already know: Ron DeSantis’s conservative principles, proven track record, and his commitment to our country are exactly what we need in a leader. It was my honor to serve in his administration and it is my honor today to endorse him for President of the United States.\"\n\nDESANTIS SAYS ANHEUSER-BUSCH IS TOO WOKE, HAS LOST HIM AS A CUSTOMER: 'WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DRINK BUD LIGHT?'\n\nLee is the third House Republican to back DeSantis.\n\nReps.

STEUBE, ROSE ENDORSE TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT\n\nDeSantis has not yet announced his candidacy, although he is expected to launch a presidential campaign when the Florida legislative session ends next month.\n\nA pro-DeSantis political action committee has remained dedicated to ramping up the governor’s chances in a potential bout with Trump, slowly building up his political operation and war chest. A super PAC named Never Back Down, staffed with top Republican operatives and communications, was formed in March to help DeSantis get elected.\n\nWhile DeSantis’ magic number is currently at three, Trump has over 50 lawmakers rallying behind him.\n\nNine U.S. Senators — Ted Budd of North Carolina, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, Eric Schmitt of Missouri, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, and JD Vance of Ohio — and over 45 House Republicans have publicly endorsed the former president.\n\nThe other U.S. Senator from South Carolina, Tim Scott, has launched an exploratory committee for his own potential White House bid.\n\nREP.

Ron DeSantis' political orbit tells Fox News he wouldn’t be surprised if up to 30-40 Republican members of Congress stop by a reception being headlined by the conservative two-term Florida governor late Tuesday afternoon and evening in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington D.C.\n\nThe \"meet-and-greet policy discussion\" gathering is being hosted by And to the Republic, a recently formed nonprofit group that organized the Florida governor's February events in New York City and suburban Philadelphia and Chicago that supported law enforcement. And the DC mixer is taking place at a Heritage Foundation townhouse on Capitol Hill. Heritage is one of the oldest and most influential think tanks in the conservative movement.\n\nThe source told Fox News that DeSantis, who has rarely returned to the nation's capital since he left Congress in 2018 amid his successful gubernatorial campaign, came back this week to say hello to old colleagues and friends, and because of the interest among congressional Republicans in the conservative legislative victories by DeSantis and GOP state lawmakers. The source added that the governor wanted \"to thank these guys for holding the line against [President] Biden and encouraging them to keep doing it.\"\n\nPROTEST BRIEFLY INTERRUPTS DESANTIS SPEECH IN KEY PRIMARY STATE\n\nAmong the small group of Republican House members and senators who were co-hosting the event or expected to attend were Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), and Chip Roy (R-Texas), the only two members of Congress who have endorsed the Florida governor's anticipated presidential run.\n\nWhile he currently remains on the 2024 sidelines, DeSantis is expected to launch a presidential campaign after next month’s conclusion of the Florida legislative session.\n\nSources in DeSantis political orbit for months have told Fox News that a declaration of candidacy by the governor in the White House race – should it happen – would occur likely in late May or June, after state government legislative business in Tallahassee quiets down.\n\nWHO'S IN AND WHO'S ON THE SIDELINES — YOUR GUIDE TO THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE\n\nMeanwhile, in the past couple of months, DeSantis has slowly started to build up his political operation. And a pro-DeSantis super PAC named Never Back Down – which sources say will be the main outside vehicle helping an expected DeSantis 2024 campaign – was formed in March and over the past month has dramatically beefed up its staff with top Republican operatives and communications. Never Back Down is now trading fire with MAGA Inc., the top super PAC supporter former President Donald Trump's third White House bid.\n\nThe former president and his allies – who view DeSantis as Trump's top threat to capturing the GOP presidential nomination – have been targeting DeSantis since last autumn, but have picked up the pace of attacks the past couple of months.\n\nThe DeSantis trip to DC – he'll return to the DC area to headline the Friday morning session of Heritage's leadership summit, which is being held at National Harbor – comes after Reps. Greg Steube, John Rutherford, and Brian Mast this week brought to seven the number of GOP House members to endorse Trump, who's also a Sunshine State resident.\n\nTrump's presidential campaign in November was followed by only a trickle of endorsements from Republican members of Congress.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut as Trump's position as the clear front-runner in the burgeoning Republican presidential nomination race has become more pronounced this spring, the pace of congressional endorsements has accelerated.\n\nTrump – as of Tuesday evening – could boast the backing of nine senators and 46 House members.",

                    "snippet": "ORLANDO, Fla. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was in Washington on Tuesday to greet a parade of congressional Republicans interested in his emerging presidential campaign. Former President Donald Trump promptly rained on that parade with a shower of endorsements, several of them from their shared home state.\n\nTrump has so far been endorsed by at least six Republican members of Florida’s congressional delegation, two of whom signed up within hours of each other Tuesday, with Trump boasting the support of Reps. Greg Steube and John Rutherford.\n\nMAGA Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC, later said Rep. Brian Mast of Florida had endorsed Trump, as well. Mast's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs pressure mounted over Trump’s racking up endorsement wins in Florida, DeSantis on Tuesday announced the backing of Republican Rep. Laurel Lee. It is the only endorsement he has from his home state delegation. Lee was DeSantis’ first secretary of state.\n\n“The only people who like Ron DeSantis are the people who have never met him,” Taylor Budowich, the CEO of MAGA Inc., said after the wave of Florida Republicans backed Trump.\n\nTrump has gained significantly more congressional support than DeSantis, who is not expected to announce his formal bid for president until May or June.\n\nDeSantis spent most of his first term in office building a reputation among national conservatives as the aspirational ideal of what a governor should be, in large part because of a hands-off approach to the Covid pandemic. But after Trump formally announced in November that he was again running for president, DeSantis has been bludgeoned with near-daily attacks from the notoriously pugilistic former president. Since then, DeSantis’ popularity has declined in public polling, prompting some donors originally committed to DeSantis to question whether he's ready for the big leagues.\n\nTrump now has at least a half-dozen Florida congressional endorsements from a 20-person GOP delegation. He previously picked up the support of Reps. Matt Gaetz, Anna Paulina Luna and Cory Mills, all of whom had long been predicted to side with Trump. But he was also backed by Rep. Byron Donalds, a DeSantis ally who introduced him at his 2022 election night victory party.\n\nDeSantis’ political operation remains undeterred.\n\n“The men and women of the Never Back Down are the voices of grassroots calling for Governor DeSantis to run because they see a fighter unafraid to stand up to the woke left and the media to deliver real results,” said Erin Perrine, a spokeswoman for the pro-DeSantis super PAC Never Back Down.\n\nDonalds’ endorsement, however, surprised DeSantis’ political team and prompted adviser Ryan Tyson to reach out to members of Florida’s congressional delegation to ask them to hold off on endorsing Trump for the foreseeable future. Steube is among the members Tyson called but who still decided to back Trump in an interview Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“I’m happy and honored to endorse Donald J. Trump for president in 2024,” Steube told Newsmax. “He’s the only person that can reverse, on day one, all of these disastrous policies of the Biden administration. And the type of things that have happened under the Biden administration would have never happened under President Trump.”\n\nBrian Jack, who was a political director in the Trump White House, is heading up what campaign aides say is a coordinated effort to roll out endorsements — often timed with Trump’s travel to various states.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said: “We’re strategically rolling out endorsements to coincide with events that we put on. There’s a strategic way to do it to get the most bang out of your buck. We’re being very cognizant of that; we’re being very deliberate. There’s a plan for all of this.”\n\nWhile Trump hasn’t been on the road this week, several Florida lawmakers endorsed him in rapid succession as DeSantis traveled to Washington to meet with lawmakers from across the country.\n\nThe meetings didn’t all go as DeSantis had planned. In a particularly abasing moment, Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, backed Trump after he walked out of the DeSantis huddle at the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\n“I met with Governor DeSantis, and while he has done commendable work in Florida, there is no doubt in my mind that President Trump is the only leader who can save America from the leftist onslaught we are currently facing,” Gooden said in a statement.\n\nOverall, Trump has endorsements from more than 50 members of Congress: 42 House members and nine senators. DeSantis has just three, all from House members.\n\nSen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, who offered an early endorsement of Trump's 2024 bid, said in an interview that he has encouraged colleagues to support Trump's campaign. Vance credited Trump's political advisers for locking down congressional endorsements and predicted other \"marquee senators\" could soon join the list.\n\nVance also praised the strategic timing of the recent Florida endorsements.\n\n\"They're rolling this stuff out with maximum effect,\" he said.\n\nRepublican former Rep. Francis Rooney of Florida, who hasn’t formally endorsed DeSantis but has praised him and opposes Trump’s re-election bid, said there is one reason for the early wave of Trump congressional endorsements: job security.\n\n“The penultimate instinct of an elected official is to keep their job. And the base down here, many, they love Trump,” said Rooney, a longtime GOP donor who represented a deeply conservative southwest Florida House seat from 2017 to 2021. “Those members read that polling about his support going up after the indictment. Democrats were super smart to indict him. They would rather run against Trump.”\n\nRooney, who was the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican in the administration of President George W. Bush, said he still thinks that it’s early and that momentum will ebb and flow.\n\n“At this stage in 1976, no one took Jimmy Carter seriously. At this stage, no one knew who Barack Obama was,” he said. “Things can change. People can peak early, and Trump definitely has more pitfalls to deal with.”\n\nMatt Dixon reported from Orlando, Jonathan Allen from Washington and Henry J. Gomez from Cleveland.",

                    "snippet": "CNN —\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis met behind closed doors with a select group of congressional Republicans on Tuesday evening in Washington as he seeks support from within his party to challenge Donald Trump for the GOP nomination in 2024.\n\nHe was coy about his future presidential ambitions and did not divulge details of when he might formally enter the race, multiple Republican lawmakers told CNN as they left the event. But he admitted in private conversations with members that he’s seriously considering a bid.\n\n“I’ve known Mr. DeSantis for years,” said one attendee, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who served with him as a member of the House Freedom Caucus. “Look, he’s been a tremendous success in Florida and perhaps he’s gonna choose to do that for the United States.”\n\nBut while many members who attended Tuesday’s meeting consistently lauded DeSantis and his work in Florida, they also refused to offer their endorsement of him – at least this early on, telling CNN they plan to reserve their judgment until later in the primary.\n\n“No, I’m not [endorsing] at this point,” said Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado. “It’s an honor to see him. And I think it’s great that he’s here. … it’s gonna be a good group of people who run that will give Republicans a good choice.”\n\nRep. Bob Good of Virginia told CNN, “I think he’s America’s governor. He’s done an outstanding job and the people of Florida rewarded him with a 20-point win. He’s an example to everybody.” But the Virginia Republican refused to say whether he’d considered an endorsement.\n\nThe trip brought DeSantis to the doorstep of an institution in which he served for nearly three terms – an experience he detested, according to his recent book. He called Congress a “grotesque” place where “members are focused not on accomplishing anything meaningful” and boasted about his lack of effort climbing the leadership ladder or building alliances.\n\n“I was also not there to socialize, let alone be a fixture on the DC social circuit,” he wrote in “The Courage to be Free.”\n\nBut now, on the precipice of a 2024 presidential campaign, DeSantis’ lack of inroads there are sending troubling signals to political supporters. Hours ahead of his meeting with congressional Republicans, Florida Rep. John Rutherford endorsed Trump, making him the sixth House Republican to back the former president over their home state governor. Additionally, Florida Rep. Brian Mast told CNN ahead of the meet-and-greet that he planned to back Trump.\n\nNBC reported last week that DeSantis’ political operation was scrambling to convince Florida Republicans not to endorse until after he had formally decided to run.\n\nFlorida Rep. Greg Steube, who endorsed Trump on the eve of the governor’s visit to Washington, told the Sarasota Herald Tribune five days ago that DeSantis’ team had attempted contact with him, yet added: “When we are ready to endorse a candidate for president, we will.”\n\nThe attempt to slow momentum for Trump began in earnest after Rep. Byron Donalds announced he was getting behind the former president, according to sources close to undecided Florida Republicans. That endorsement “sent shockwaves through the entire Florida delegation,” one source said, because Donalds was considered the closest to DeSantis of any House Republican in the state. Donalds had introduced DeSantis at his victory rally on Election Night last year.\n\n“When Donalds came out, that sent a message to other members, ‘What are we missing? What is going on?’” the source said.\n\nRep. Laurel Lee, a former Florida secretary of state under DeSantis, backed the governor on Tuesday ahead of his visit.\n\n“DeSantis fights for what matters,” she said, “and he wins when it matters most.”\n\nA spokesman for DeSantis’ political operation did not return a call or email.\n\nCongressional endorsements are hardly the barometer by which voters choose their nominees. If such was the case, Trump would not have won the GOP primary race in 2016.\n\nBut by plucking support from within DeSantis’ backyard, Trump has created the impression that even Republicans close to DeSantis may be having second thoughts about his performance.\n\n“I think it only matters if Trump makes it matter,” said ex-Rep. David Jolly, a former Republican who served alongside DeSantis. “Which clearly he is,” Jolly added.\n\nDeSantis throughout his career has relished the outsider image he cultivated while working in Washington. He slept in his office, went home most weekends and often walked Congress’ cavernous tunnels with earbuds in. Instead of aligning himself with Florida Republicans or GOP leadership, he helped form the Freedom Caucus, a conservative group of lawmakers that has at times created headaches for the party.\n\nWhen Florida’s delegation would meet to strategize on legislation, DeSantis was known to sit in the back of the chamber talking on his phone.\n\n“I don’t remember a single Florida delegation meeting he attended,” Jolly said. “We had lunch once a month, just casually to just catch up. I’m not sure he ever attended a single one. He was not a team player. It doesn’t surprise me that he doesn’t have much loyalty in the delegation.”\n\nBut while he was once a little-known congressional backbencher, DeSantis as governor has become Florida’s most popular and powerful elected leader, outshining many of the Republicans he once served by leaning into cultural clashes that have animated the GOP faithful in the years since Trump left office.\n\nAhead of the visit, DeSantis escalated his fight with Disney over a state bill that restricts the teaching of certain LGBTQ topics, suggesting that the state could build a prison or competing theme park next to the entertainment giant’s iconic theme parks and threatening legislation to ensure a state takeover of the company’s special taxing district. His political operation, meanwhile, released a parody Bud Light commercial making fun of transgender athletes.\n\nSurveys of GOP voters continue to show that DeSantis is Trump’s chief rival for the nomination, often leading the rest of the field by double digits.\n\nDeSantis met Tuesday night with, among others, Reps. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, Randy Feenstra and Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa, Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida, Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, Dan Crenshaw of Texas and Andy Barr of Kentucky. Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, and Lee of Florida – all of whom have endorsed DeSantis – were also seen. Among the Trump-backers in attendance were Rutherford and Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas, who endorsed the former president shortly after leaving the meeting. Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah were also there.\n\nDeSantis will also visit the DC area on Friday for a speech at the Heritage Foundation 50th anniversary leadership summit, an organization that has showered Florida’s leader with praise throughout his years in office.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.",

                    "snippet": "In a blow to Ron DeSantis, a prominent ally of the rightwing governor was on Tuesday one of two Florida Republicans in Congress to back Donald Trump for president, the latest in a string of such defections.\n\nThe news came amid reports that DeSantis’s team has pressured US representatives from his state not to endorse Trump.\n\nBrian Mast told CNN he planned to endorse the former president and would chair a veterans committee in support of his re-election bid.\n\nPeter Schorsch, publisher of FloridaPolitics.com, said: “This is right up there with Byron Donalds picking Trump over DeSantis.”\n\nDonalds introduced DeSantis for his election night speech in November, after his landslide win over the Democrat Charlie Crist. Last week, though, Donalds told NBC he plumped for Trump because he was a candidate “ready for prime time”.\n\nSchorsch added: “Brian Mast has been DeSantis’s ally on environment and water issues in South Florida. Mast is at DeSantis’s hip during press conferences. They’re both veterans, too. Wow.”\n\nMast and John Rutherford were the sixth and seventh congressional Florida Republicans to endorse Trump. Rutherford announced his decision in a tweet.\n\n“As a former sheriff,” he said, “I understand the importance of a fair and impartial system of justice. The systematic targeting of Americans with conservative ideals, especially our 45th president of the United States, disgraces our nation’s legacy.”\n\nHe was referring to Trump’s criminal indictment in New York this month, on 34 counts of falsification of business records relating to his hush money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nTrump also faces legal jeopardy over his election subversion and incitement of the deadly January 6 attack on Congress, his handling of classified material, his business and tax affairs and an allegation of rape. He denies all wrongdoing.\n\nHis sheriff-turned-congressman supporter added: “As strong Republicans, we must restore law, order and justice to our country … under President Trump’s leadership, America was more safe, more secure, and more prosperous.”\n\nTrump lost conclusively to Joe Biden in 2020, a year of chaos amid the Covid pandemic and protests for racial justice.\n\nFor inciting an insurrection in his attempt to overturn that defeat, fueled by the lie that Biden won thanks to electoral fraud, Trump was impeached a second time. But he escaped conviction and is now the clear leader in the race for the GOP nomination, leveraging his legal predicament to boost fundraising and support.\n\nDeSantis has not declared his candidacy but is widely expected to do so. He is Trump’s closest challenger but his numbers have stagnated as he has come under fire for extreme policies including a six-week abortion ban, school book bans and a drawn-out fight with Disney. Last week, a major donor said he was pausing support.\n\nBy Tuesday, Trump had secured endorsements from one governor (Henry McMaster of South Carolina), nine senators and 47 House members. Lance Gooden, a Texas Republican, released his endorsement of Trump shortly after what he called “a positive meeting” with DeSantis in Washington.\n\nNBC first reported DeSantis allies calls to Florida Republicans. An unnamed source said: “There is clearly some angst from the DeSantis camp that so many members of the state’s congressional delegation are throwing their support behind Trump.”\n\nRutherford and Mast were not among Republicans named. The New York Times, however, cited an official “familiar with the effort” when it said “others in the 20-member Republican delegation from Florida are almost certainly on the call list”.\n\nOne Republican named by NBC, Laurel Lee, endorsed DeSantis on Tuesday. Another, Greg Steube, declared for Trump on Monday.",

Photo: Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nFormer President Trump and some other potential 2024 candidates are hammering Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) over his punitive actions against the Walt Disney Company.\n\nWhy it matters: The mounting criticism from potential 2024 rivals over DeSantis' Disney feud underscores what is becoming a growing attack line against the Florida governor.\n\nDriving the news: Trump, who announced his 2024 bid last year, wrote on his Truth Social account Tuesday that the Florida governor \"is being absolutely destroyed by Disney\" and called the governor's move a \"political stunt.\"\n\n\"His original P.R. plan fizzled, so now he’s going back with a new one in order to save face,\" Trump wrote.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said during a Semafor event on Tuesday that DeSantis' actions against Disney are not in line with that of a conservative.\n\n\"As a conservative, the job of government is … to stay out of the business of business,\" Christie said of DeSantis, who is considered a top 2024 contender although he has not formally announced.\n\n“I don't think Ron DeSantis is a conservative,\" Christie said.\n\n\"That’s not the guy I want sitting across from President Xi and negotiating our next agreement with China, or sitting across from Putin and trying to resolve what’s happening in Ukraine, if you can’t see around a corner,\" Christie said.\n\nChristie also told Semafor that he plans to make a decision about running for president over the next couple of weeks.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence struck a similar tone to Christie earlier this year and said that DeSantis went too far in his actions against Disney.\n\nPence told CNBC in February that he opposed the Florida governor's measure to punish Disney for opposing legislation that critics have dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill.\n\n\"That was beyond the scope of what I as a conservative, limited-government Republican would be prepared to do,” Pence said.\n\nZoom out: DeSantis' ongoing public feud with Disney began after the company called out the law that limits classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThe sparring escalated this week when DeSantis introduced a legislative proposal aimed at nullifying Walt Disney's recent effort to restrict the state's ability to rein in future development at Disney World.\n\nDeSantis on Monday also signaled interest in developing the land in possession of the governor-appointed board into a park or a state prison.\n\nA spokesperson for DeSantis did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.\n\nGo deeper...

Ron DeSantis, who's considering a run for the presidency, made overtures to congressional Republicans during a visit to Washington, D.C., Tuesday, as notable GOP members from his home state decided to back former President Donald Trump\n\nLawmakers who attended DeSantis' policy discussion said they were keeping their powder dry and wouldn't make any endorsements just yet.\n\nRepublicans at Tuesday's event described it as a very casual, mellow discussion over cocktails. Held at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank's office near Capitol Hill, lawmakers said DeSantis offered brief remarks about his successes in Florida and his legislative agenda, before chatting one-on-one with them.\n\nSens. John Cornyn of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah attended DeSantis' event, and maybe \"well over two dozen\" House Republicans came by, some attendees estimated. Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Ken Buck of Colorado and Randy Feenstra of Iowa were listed as special guests in attendance.\n\nPennsylvania Republican Rep. Dan Meuser called the Florida governor a \"significant\" Republican leader and said during the event that DeSantis had \"alluded to the idea that he's giving [a 2024 run] consideration\" during his remarks.\n\nBut Meuser and others say they haven't decided who to endorse and are hoping for a crowded primary. Several mentioned Trump and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, and possible candidates former Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Scott.\n\nThe Florida governor is expected to make a final decision to enter the race sometime after his state's legislative session ends in early May.\n\n\"I think the people should have a lot of options. I encourage everybody to run,\" said Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw after the event. He added that he would not be endorsing anyone in the 2024 GOP presidential primary.\n\nWhile some have floated the idea that DeSantis may have already missed his window, Crenshaw dismissed the notion: \"I don't think so,\" he said. \"There's a lot of time left.\"\n\n\"I just want to beat Democrats. A lot of Republicans can beat Democrats, it shouldn't be that hard to beat Biden's record,\" he added.\n\nVirginia Rep. Bob Good, who hasn't made any endorsement yet, called DeSantis \"America's governor\" and opined that \"there's a whole lot of Americans that would be excited about him running.\"\n\nSeven members of Florida's congressional delegation, including three this week, endorsed Trump over DeSantis, while one, Rep. Laurel Lee, who is also a former Florida secretary of state, is backing a DeSantis run.\n\nTexas Rep. Lance Gooden attended DeSantis' event Tuesday, but said in a statement afterward that he's endorsing Trump.\n\nThough he said DeSantis \"has done commendable work in Florida,\" Gooden wrote in a tweet that \"there is no doubt in my mind that President Trump is the only leader who can save America from the leftist onslaught we are currently facing.\" .\n\nTennessee Rep. Andy Ogles gave little weight to the early endorsements from Florida, saying, \"it's a part of politics\" and that candidates sometimes get \"caught up in the endorsement game.\"\n\nJustin Sayfie, a longtime Republican strategist who worked on Florida Governor Jeb Bush's 2016 campaign, noted that Bush had more congressional endorsements that Trump in that primary.\n\n\"I'm not sure it had an impact that people thought it would have,\" Sayfie said. \"I think in all of politics endorsements from elected officials are a lot less valuable today than they were 30 years ago,\" he said.\n\nRep. Buck was listed as a special guest but did not reveal who he would endorse. He said while \"it's an honor\" to have DeSantis in town, it's more important for his potential candidacy to keep connecting with voters outside the Capitol.\n\n\"The real Americans suffering are outside the Beltway. They're the ones that need to talk to these candidates,\" he said.",

                    "snippet": "Former President Trump today accused Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis of flying too close to the sun with his war on Disney, setting up a key test of whether the GOP base is more beholden to personality or policy.\n\nWhy it matters: DeSantis' meteoric rise has been fueled in large part by his championing of the conservative culture war. By criticizing DeSantis' feud with Disney as a \"political stunt,\" Trump appears to be opposing an \"anti-woke\" crusade that many MAGA activists have thus far supported.\n\nDriving the news: DeSantis unveiled a proposal yesterday to override Disney's effort to circumvent state oversight of Walt Disney World — suggesting, with a smile, that Florida could build a new state prison next to the park.\n\nThe battle with one of Florida's largest employers began when Disney publicly denounced the GOP's Parental Rights in Education Bill, dubbed by critics as the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill.\n\nDeSantis responded with legislation in April 2022 that revoked the special status of Reedy Creek, a municipal district operated by Disney. In late February, he signed a bill transferring control of the district to the state.\n\nBoard members later discovered that the Disney-allied board approved agreements that gave the company authority over most of the future construction in the district — triggering DeSantis' latest broadsides.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"DeSanctus is being absolutely destroyed by Disney,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, predicting that the corporation's next move would be to freeze or withdraw investment in Florida.\n\n\"In the meantime, this is all so unnecessary, a political STUNT!\" Trump added.\n\nZoom in: Disney is a political and economic force in central Florida: A 2019 study found Orlando's tourism industry generated $75.2 billion in annual economic impact, 463,000 jobs and $5.8 billion in additional state tax revenue.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is considering running for president as an anti-Trump candidate, blasted DeSantis for defying conservative principles by interfering in \"the business of business.\"\n\n\"You have to admit when you screwed up and got taken. It happens,\" Christie told Semafor this morning.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence also criticized DeSantis for taking his Disney feud too far in February, even as he voiced approval for the original education bill.\n\nBetween the lines: Disney is not the only issue on which Trump's political instincts may be more in line with the public.\n\nTrump has relentlessly hammered DeSantis for voting as a member of Congress to cut Social Security and Medicare to help balance the budget — a mainstream position in the pre-Trump GOP.\n\nTrump is widely believed to be more liberal on abortion than most Republicans, but he has been conspicuously silent on DeSantis' recent signing of a six-week abortion ban.\n\nWhat to watch: Donald Trump Jr. has faced some criticism from conservatives for calling for an end to the boycott of Bud Light, which was launched in response to its partnership with a transgender activist.",

Ron DeSantis.\n\n\"I met with Governor DeSantis, and while he has done commendable work in Florida, there is no doubt in my mind that President Trump is the only leader who can save America from the leftist onslaught we are currently facing,\" Gooden said in a press release.\n\nDESANTIS MINGLES WITH CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS AS TRUMP EXPANDS HIS ENDORSEMENT LEAD IN 2024 RACE\n\n\"President Trump is a tireless fighter, a champion of American jobs, a guardian of our economy, and a bulwark against the relentless invasion of our borders by illegal immigrants. He unyieldingly supported our military and veterans, and bravely stood up to the dangerous socialist agenda propagated by the radical left,\" he said.\n\n\"I wholeheartedly endorse President Donald J.

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., and Rep. Diana Harshbarger, R-Tenn., among others.\n\nDeSantis is reportedly mulling his own run for the White House, but has not yet said whether he will officially launch a campaign.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPolls have shown Trump as the clear front-runner in the race, far ahead of his already declared opponents, former U.N.

                    "snippet": "The indictment of former President Donald Trump was excellent for fundraising, according to new data from his 2024 campaign. According to Politico, Trump’s overall earnings for the first quarter of the year were nearly $168,000 per day. However, $4 million flowed in within a day of his New York indictment on March 30.\n\nAccording to Republican digital strategist Eric Wilson, “Anytime a candidate’s name is all over the media and dominating attention, it’s good for fundraising. The nonstop coverage just made donors think of him.”\n\nTrump has emphasized his court disputes in his fundraising appeals. One of the campaign emails states, “With the witch hunts heating up like never before, please make a contribution to stand with me in the fight to SAVE AMERICA.”\n\nThe indictment of Trump has only led to record fundraising, record polling numbers against primary opponents to the point of no return, and endorsements are reaching new heights. pic.twitter.com/gEHe5OHZm4 — @garibaldi_the_great (@flamingarrow98) April 17, 2023\n\nRELATED: GOP Donors, Including Thomas Pafferty, Reportedly Abandon DeSantis for Being Too Pro-Life\n\nBig Bucks Roll In\n\nSmall donations were made in response from supporters; according to Trump staff, more than 97% of them contributed less than $200 in the two weeks following their candidate’s arrest. Compared to what Trump brought in as president, these sums are paltry. For his reelection campaign, he raised more over $30 million in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nAfter spending $3.5 million in the first quarter, the Trump presidential campaign reported having $13.9 million in cash on hand as of March 31. In contrast, Nikki Haley, a former UN ambassador, only has $7.8 million on hand.\n\nOn the other side, the groups supporting Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have significantly more money, with one claiming to have $85 million in cash.\n\nOfficials from Trump did not specify whether the increase following the indictment continued into the first quarter of the second quarter. More information should be available in a Trump report that is due to the Federal Election Commission before Saturday.\n\nRELATED: Trump Snags Big Endorsements from Republican Senators as 2024 Primary Heats Up\n\nRELATED: Team DeSantis Releases First Ad Attacking Trump: He’s Stealing Pages from the Biden-Pelosi Playbook!\n\nRELATED: DeSantis Team Allegedly Contacting Remaining FL State Politicians to Not Endorse Donald Trump\n\nReprinted with permission.

Byron Donalds, only on his second term but already popular with the MAGA section of the Republican Party, announced his support for President Trump.\n\nThat event, according to some reports, has Team DeSantis scrambling to beg other Florida Republicans not to announce their preference during the primary.\n\nBut just as important for Trump is new institutional support, from corners not normally associated with America First or the MAGA wing of the party.\n\nLast week, Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn – popular with some conservatives though certainly not MAGA – announced, “He did it once, and he will do it again. President Trump will Make America Great Again, and I look forward to having him back in the White House.”\n\nYesterday, Trump also received the backing of Tennessee’s other senator, Bill Hagerty:\n\nIt is my honor to give my whole-hearted endorsement to Donald J.

                    "snippet": "Donald Trump leaves Manhattan courtroom in New York\n\nHillary Clinton has poured cold water on Donald Trump’s 2024 electoral prospects as she doubts the former president will make a spectacular return to the White House next year. Clinton, 75, said she cannot see the controversial 76-year-old Republican winning the electoral contest in 2024 as the American people are “on to him and his behaviour more than they were before”. The promiment Democrat lost to Trump in the 2016 presidential election, despite the latter losing the popular vote. Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton by more than 2.8 million votes but won 30 states and the decisive electoral college with 304 electoral votes to Clinton’s 227. READ MORE: US holds biggest military ‘elephant walk’ ever to terrify Putin and Xi\n\nClinton doubts Trump will win the 2024 election\n\nSpeaking to Beth Rigby on Sky News, Clinton suggested Trump's previous record as president has scuppered his chances of being re-elected: “He accuses people of doing things he himself is doing. “It's a form of psychological projection. And I always thought that his record in business in particular, but then as we saw him in politics and government, he was someone who cared nothing about rules.” It comes after the ex-President had 36 felony charges brought him against him for falsifying business records concerned with an alleged hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in 2016. This was the same year Trump beat Clinton in the presidential elections. Trump pleaded not guilty despite the Manhattan jury’s vote to indict him earlier this month in a historic first for a former or serving US president. There are other indictments looming over Trump’s head too. He could be brought before a jury to explain the cache of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and may be charged for obstruct the FBI in its efforts to obtain them. Trump could also be charged for asking Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” extra votes to help him secure election victory, a recording of which emerged in 2021.\n\nTrending\n\nTrump is still running in 2024 despite his indictment\n\nHis run-ins with the law have not stopped him from running in the 2024 presidential race, which several polls suggest the former president is still the frontrunner in. But Clinton doubts that the Republican favourite is in with a shot. She said: “He cared nothing about the law. So he has been indicted and there may be others as well. But he has said he's going to keep running. And there's nothing in our current system of laws that would prevent him from running. “But even if he gets the Republican nomination, he cannot, in my view, be re-elected president.”\n\nDeSantis could run against Trump in the Republican primary\n\nBack in 2016, Trump repeatedly accused Clinton, who was running against him as the Democrat’s presidential candidate, of breaking the law. He also actively encouraged the chants “lock her up” that were directed at Clinton. When asked why she thinks Trump can’t win, Clinton responded: “I think more people are on to him and his behaviour than they were before. “He has a hard core of support that is likely to help him win the Republican nomination. But in a general election against President Biden, I do not believe he can win.” But polls have suggested it may not be an easy ride to victory for Trump in the Republican primary.\n\nTrending",

Justin Pearson, who was also recently reinstated.\n\nDemonstrators led by Bishop William Barber II had marched in Nashville on Monday, demanding that lawmakers pass the gun safety legislation and stop using their authority to trample democracy. They carried several caskets symbolizing those lost to gun violence on Monday.\n\n“The legislators are back, but returning duly elected lawmakers to their seat does not solve the problem,” Barber said, demanding that lawmakers “stop committing policy murder.”\n\nThe fatal shooting of six people at a Nashville private school last month kicked off a stream of calls for changes to Tennessee’s gun laws, including a ban on assault weapons, tougher background checks and a “red flag” law. Republican Gov. Bill Lee has urged lawmakers to pass legislation that would keep firearms away from people who could harm themselves or others. So far, the Republican supermajority has refused.\n\nReps. Jones and Pearson, both Democrats, returned to the GOP-dominated General Assembly last week after being ousted for their role in a pro-gun control demonstration from the House floor. The episode has turned Tennessee into a new front in the battle for the future of American democracy and pressured lawmakers to address gun control in a state known for its lax firearm regulations.\n\nOn Monday, when protesters were blocked from bringing caskets into the Capitol, Jones carried an infant-sized casket inside and walked with protesters, including Barber, through the building. When he reached the House chamber, the sergeant-at-arms stopped Jones from bringing it onto the floor. As Jones entered the chamber after the session and tried unsuccessfully to get the attention of Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton, Pearson held the casket at the door. When Sexton left, he stopped for a moment to speak to a few protesters.",

                    "snippet": "The year before an actual presidential election year is almost as important as the election year itself. Would-be candidates are deciding whether to throw their hat in the ring, PACS are being formed, money raised, and the general look of a party primary is taking shape. While there will be many things that will be different for Republicans from 2016 and definitely 2020, 2024 already has one big thing in common with those past presidential election years: Former President Donald Trump is out in front of all other declared candidates — and as a former president, he has a record. Granted, it is very early, and a lot can happen before November 2024. Democrats are coming at Trump with all sorts of legal challenges, and throwing them at any wall they think will be sticky enough. But while GOP candidates are making the case to voters as to why they should be the next president, are they really making a case as to why Donald Trump does not deserve a second term?\n\nThis doesn't mean Trump will be the GOP nominee in 2024. It, as with other recent polls, does demonstrate why the other Republican candidates are too scared to criticize Trump, even as he possibly faces multiple indictments. https://t.co/N0IjphqkhE — SpideyTerry (@SpideyTerry) March 22, 2023\n\nTrump’s nicknames for his opponents are, in some ways, half the fun of a Trump campaign. Who can forget “low energy” Jeb Bush, “little Marco” Rubio, and perhaps the best one of all (and still used today): “crooked” Hillary Clinton. So far, among declared candidates Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Asa Hutchinson, no clear taunting nicknames have emerged. Even though he has not made any announcements, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has on several occasions been referred to as Ron “DeSanctimonious.”\n\nEarly criticism has come in veiled form. Never Back Down is a GOP super PAC supporting DeSantis. Apparently, Never Back Down’s main beef with Donald Trump, is that he is too mean to DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis Super PAC \"Never Back Down\" launched it's first ad with over $3.5m behind it 🔽🔽🔽 pic.twitter.com/RiGLExcBOS — Adam Wise (@DAdamWise) April 17, 2023\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Tim Scott, who has formed a presidential exploratory committee, was recently asked why Republican voters might reject Trump this time around. His response:\n\nOne of the things I’m hearing a lot on the Faith in America Tour is that they’re concerned about the most important issues in their lives is what’s driving their decisions. And one of the most important issues in their lives is the economic reality that President Biden seems to have figured out a blueprint for how to ruin America.\n\nNikki Haley has been the only declared GOP candidate that has dipped a toe in the water of Trump criticism. During a recent campaign stop in Iowa, she took a veiled swipe at Trump saying, “You’re not gonna see me come in and do a rally and leave.” And in a recent interview, Haley went one step further, saying, “We have to move forward. We can’t deal with the drama that’s following him. We can’t deal with the baggage.”\n\nDonald Trump’s fellow GOP candidates do have a problem. They are free to go after Trump on his legal issues or statements he has made in the past. But voters may have another take. Trump’s poll numbers jumped from 43.8 percent prior to Trump announcing the indictment was coming to 44.4 percent after the indictment announcement, to 56.2 percent after the actual indictment. If other candidates want to make an issue of tweets or other past statements, that could come off to voters as the candidates themselves not wanting to move forward.\n\nBut the biggest hurdle other Republican candidates may have when it comes to any criticism of Donald Trump is that Trump is a unique candidate. He is a former President and therefore has a track record — a good one. Candidates are certainly free to criticize Trump’s pre-COVID economy, energy independence, secure southern border, and a very strong presence abroad, but voters could have a long memory. There is the fact that Obamacare was not done away with, or that the border wall was not completed, but this is a narrow window.\n\nMake no mistake, though — at some point, the criticism of Donald Trump will begin, and someone else will get a catchy new nickname.\n\nThe Reagan rule (never speak ill of a fellow Republican) was completely thrown out the window in 2016, but the 2024 crop of GOP Presidential candidates still think it applies. Until somebody goes all in on attacking Trump PERSONALLY, they’re all just ceding the 2024 nomination… — Brian Paterson ⚫️⚪️ (@ashenthorn) April 14, 2023\n\nThe opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.",

                    "snippet": "INDIANAPOLIS, Indiana — Former Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News exclusively that he is “weeks not months” away from giving the public a “clearer idea” about whether he will run for president in 2024.\n\n“We’re getting closer. We’re getting a lot of encouragement,” Pence said when asked by Breitbart News if he is any closer to a formal decision on a White House bid. “I’ll be back in Iowa next week. I’ll be in California. Look, I think this country is in a lot of trouble. When I think about the way the Lord has blessed my family to be a leader in the Congress, to be a governor of a successful state, to be a Vice President in a consequential conservative administration, my wife and I are continuing to reflect and pray about what our role might be, but I expect we’ll have a clearer idea and you’ll have a clearer idea in weeks, not months.”\n\nPence, who has been crisscrossing the nation in recent months promoting his vision for the country, has long been considering a campaign for the White House. Should he decide to run, that decision would pit him against his former running mate, former President Donald Trump—the current frontrunner for the GOP nomination—and several others, including declared candidates former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) has launched an exploratory committee for the office, and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are both said to be actively exploring campaigns. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is also considering running, and a group he controls that would become a Super PAC should he get in the race—called “Never Back Down”—has been hiring political consultants as staff. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, meanwhile, formally ruled out a bid in 2024 last week, saying he has decided he will not run this cycle for the presidency.\n\nPence’s interview with Breitbart News came just before his speech at the National Rifle Association (NRA) annual gathering on Friday afternoon last week, where both he and Trump faced off, competing to win the hearts and minds of the GOP faithful and base voters here. Some estimates had the crowd of attendees at the full NRA conference at north of 75,000 attendees, making the gathering in Pence’s home state capital city one of the biggest annual groups of conservative voters and a major opportunity to connect with the very people who will decide the GOP nominee for president. Others, like Haley and DeSantis, sent recorded videos to be played at the convention, but Ramasawamy also appeared on stage in person.\n\nPence was happy to brag about Indiana’s success in recent years. For a state that has reddened significantly since it voted for former President Barack Obama in 2008, Pence noted that Indiana is a model for the nation for conservatism.\n\n“For most of my lifetime, Indiana had Republican and Democrat governors and senators,” Pence said, noting the state’s pedigree of being a battleground. “But we’re on a run now of going on our fifth consecutive term of Republican governors, Republican majorities in the legislature, and we’ve literally turned Indiana from a swing state into a solid red conservative state. I think it’s a result of Republican leadership, standing on conservative principles, and delivering the results that Indiana has been able to generate in terms of job creation, in terms of public safety, in terms of values, in terms of education reform.”\n\nAsked if it’s a long way from 2008 when Obama won here, Pence said, “That’s right.”\n\nTrump, of course, won the GOP nomination here in 2016, as after his victory in the GOP primary his final two competitors, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich, suspended their campaigns, clearing the way for Trump to be the GOP nominee that year. Trump would then go on to select Pence, then the governor of Indiana, to be his running mate, and the two would go on to win the White House together and defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA).\n\n“The success that our ticket had, that the president had in the primary and then we went on to have great success in 2016 and 2020 in Indiana, I think is evidence of the fact that when you put conservative principles into practice and when you deliver results, Hoosiers rally around that just like every other conservative American,” Pence told Breitbart News.\n\nPence also said that he thinks other states like Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and more are following the lead of Indiana in getting redder in recent years despite possibly having a history of bipartisanship. “I think it is,” Pence said when asked if Indiana is a model for the movement seen in other places. “I think it’s the consistent conservative message and then saying what you mean, meaning what you say, delivering on the promises, and the other piece of it is just the Democratic Party has been captured by the radical left. Literally, the policies at home and abroad are so far out of step with everyday Americans that I think we’ve got a historic opportunity in 2024 for a realignment of the direction of this country and states across the country and in our nation’s capital as well.”",

DeSantis' political rival, former President Donald Trump posted Tuesday on Truth Social that DeSantis is being \"absolutely destroyed by Disney.\"\n\n\"Disney's next move will be the announcement that no more money will be invested in Florida because of the Governor — In fact, they could even announce a slow withdrawal or sale of certain properties, or the whole thing,\" Trump wrote. \"Watch! That would be a killer. In the meantime, this is all so unnecessary, a political STUNT! Ron should work on the squatter MESS!\"\n\nNew Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, a critic and potential challenger of Trump's, sided with the former president, agreeing that DeSantis has taken the disagreement too far by targeting the company's tax status and the potential value of its land.\n\n\"Look, this has gone from kind of going after a headline to something that has devolved into an issue, and it convolutes the entire Republican message,\" Politico reported Sununu said Monday night. \"I just don't think — it's not good for Governor DeSantis. I don't think it's good for the Republican party.\"\n\nRepresentatives for DeSantis, Christie, Trump, and Sununu did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment.",

                    "snippet": "UPDATE (April 18, 2023, 6:29 p.m. ET): Fox News agreed to settle Dominion's defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million on Tuesday.\n\nAs my colleague Jordan Rubin discussed for Deadline: Legal Blog last month, the legal standard that Dominion has to meet to prove Fox defamed it is known as the actual malice standard. Put another way, Dominion must prove that Fox either actually knew that the statements it put on air were false, or that it recklessly disregarded their falsity.\n\nDeSantis has made his “open antipathy toward ‘corporate media’” a centerpiece of his state policy agenda.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that actual malice is a high bar to cross. And as Jordan has explained, at least two of the conservative Supreme Court justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, recently have signaled their desire to reexamine the court’s precedent in New York Times v. Sullivan, the nearly 60-year-old case that is the genesis of the actual malice standard.\n\nThe Dominion v. Fox News defamation trial began Tuesday. Follow our live blog for the latest updates and expert analysis at msnbc.com/dominiontrial.\n\nBut Thomas and Gorsuch are hardly alone in their willingness to topple the actual malice rule. When he’s not signing a 6-week abortion ban in the quiet of night or floating the prospect of building a state prison adjacent to Disney World, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has made his “open antipathy toward ‘corporate media’” a centerpiece of his state policy agenda.\n\nA bill DeSantis has championed in the Florida legislature not only aims to make it easier to sue major media like Fox News for defamation but contains other provisions, including a presumption that reporting cited to anonymous sources is false, that even fellow conservatives warn could endanger free speech and political commentary across the ideological spectrum.\n\nAt a time when Fox is fighting to survive Dominion’s mammoth defamation claim under a standard DeSantis thinks is already too protective of cable news, DeSantis’s campaign against corporate media is potentially awkward. After all, candidate DeSantis could have exploited Fox hosts and executives’ now-public disdain for Trump — and its desire to turn the page on the Trump era — by embracing Fox, its audience, and what seems to be their chief organizing principle: MAGA, but without the Original Red Hat.\n\nDeSantis’ war on defamation law as it exists may win him favor with newer, fringier outlets, but it also potentially puts him at odds with the biggest prospective megaphone for his 2024 campaign: the Fox News ecosystem. Whether that’s a risk worth him taking will turn, in part, on the outcome of this trial — and the resulting chink in Fox’s armor.",

Another 16 percent chose Pence, followed by 13 percent for Haley, and seven percent for Ramaswamy. Six percent have no opinion.\n\nThe survey conducted was April 14-16, 2023, among 3,499 potential Republican primary voters. It has a +/-2 percent margin of error.\n\nThe survey comes as Trump, who only has a handful of official challengers at this point — Haley, Hutchinson, and Ramaswamy — continues to dominate his potential challengers in both national and state-wide polls.\n\nWATCH: Supporters Cheer as Donald Trump Returns to Florida After Arraignment:\n\n@sammyjoms66, Eric Trump, Greg Aselbekian via Storyful\n\n“Well, I’m honored,” Trump told Breitbart News of his frontrunner status in an exclusive interview with Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle. “Sadly, I have to say part of it is because the country is doing so poorly. I wish it were for other reasons.”\n\nHe continued:\n\nThey saw how we did, and now they see the country doing so poorly and so pathetically. We’re not respected by anybody. You have wars all over. Ukraine and Russia never would have happened if I were president — zero chance. It looks like China is going to happen with Taiwan. That never would have happened. And inflation never would have happened. It was caused by energy prices more than anything else. So many of these things were just self-imposed foolish mistakes — stupid mistakes beyond anything anyone has ever seen before. So, yeah, I’m leading a lot in the polls — by 35 or 40 points in almost every poll. Texas just came in and we’re almost 50 points in Texas. Now, Massachusetts is almost 50 points.\n\n“I think the party is very unified,” Trump said of his piling endorsements. “I also think they’re looking at the polls now and they’re saying, ‘wow, that’s impressive.’ But we’re leading by so much and they’re seeing that I think people look back to those four years we had.”",

It’s unclear if there were any conditions to the interview.\n\nHe and another former convict, Alexey Savichev, previously gave long and rambling interviews to Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, saying they were among the tens of thousands of Wagner fighters recruited from Russian jails to fight in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking with Gulagu founder Vladimir Osechkin, Uldarov said he shot and killed a young girl, calling it “a management decision.”\n\n“I wasn’t allowed to let anyone out alive, because my command was to kill anything in my way,” he said, estimating that the girl was five or six years old.\n\nIn his interview with RIA-FAN — which is associated with Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin — Uldarov said he was drunk when he gave the interview, and alleged that Osechkin had blackmailed him about his time in prison.\n\nAsked by RIA-FAN: “They made you say what you said in the video, correct?” Uldarov replied: “Not only correct, it’s [expletive] correct. I had to say it because I had no choice.”\n\n“I said whatever I was told to say,” Uldarov then said.\n\n“Prigozhin is a great guy,” he added, giving a thumbs up. “He saved our lives.”\n\nBut Gulagu’s Osechkin, who is based in France, told CNN he stood by the content of his interviews with the two men, citing Uldarov’s retraction as proof of how quickly dissenting voices are silenced in Russia.\n\nOsechkin also claimed that both interviewees, Uldarov and Savichev, had been threatened with murder if they didn’t retract their statements to him. Savichev told Gulagu that his unit was ordered to kill any men 15 years old or older.\n\nRead more here",

In a video testimony with Gulagu.net, a rights group, Savichev said his command was instructed \"not to take any prisoners, and just shoot them on the spot.\"\n\nHe provided details of participating in summary executions of Ukrainian POWs, including killing 20 Ukrainian soldiers by spraying them with bullets and torturing injured soldiers by tossing grenades into their ditch.\n\nSavichev's confession sheds light on the war crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Wagner, which has recruited tens of thousands of inmates, including convicted murderers, to fight in eastern Ukraine, offers freedom if the mercenaries survive a near-suicidal six-month stint, which Savichev completed on March 12. In response to Savichev's testimony, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called for those responsible to be punished. At the same time, Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, stated that a confession was not enough and that the culprits must face harsh and fair punishment.\n\nAlthough several Russian soldiers have fled abroad and described witnessing Russian war crimes since the start of the war, Savichev's testimony is a rare account. But Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, denied accounts of former Wagner soldiers committing war crimes, calling it a \"flagrant lie.\" Savichev, who is now on the run, for fear of his life, has received multiple threats since giving the interview.",

There are almost no whole houses left. It’s practically wiped out. There’s shelling every day and every day there are more ruins,” said Denis, who joined the military last year after university. “Artillery and mortar shelling – don’t stop. Drones drop grenades. And of course there is street fighting and machine gun fire.” “You hear a boom, a whistle and then an explosion. And of course the shrapnel,” the military engineer told AFP, just hours after rotating out of the battle. “That’s the worst. It’s scary – scary for anyone,” he said, adding he had no antidote to fear other than staying home. The unit taking a short reprieve outside Bakhmut is tasked with demining Russian explosives and booby traps so Ukrainian infantry can move forward. “When you go out, you don’t know if you’re coming back,” said Oleg, 34, who works in positions around Bakhmut, often at night, often by moonlight. “They even mine the corpses of their soldiers. When they retreat, they mine absolutely everything,” he added. “You have no margin for error. It all depends on how lucky you are.” Around 70,000 people once called Bakhmut home, and despite the bloodshed and bombing, some still do. “Yesterday I saw an old woman. And I was really surprised. Everything was flying and whistling, and she was chopping firewood near the house. I guess they’re already used to it,” said Denis.\n\n\n\n36m ago 02.23 EDT Rodion Miroshnik, one of the Russian-imposed officials in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, has posted to Telegram to report that the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka, on the left-bank of the River Dniepr in the Kherson region, is under fire from Ukrainian forces. Citing the city administration, he writes “The whole city is under fire. There are already wounded.” The claims have not been independently verified.\n\n\n\n45m ago 02.14 EDT Russia has been continuing with exercises on its eastern flank, and this morning Reuters reports that the Russian ministry of defence has stated that eight of its long-range bombers flew over neutral waters in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan.\n\n\n\n1h ago 01.42 EDT Wagner mercenary admits ‘tossing grenades’ at injured Ukrainian PoWs Pjotr Sauer A former Wagner mercenary has admitted to killing and torturing dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war, in one of the most detailed first-person accounts of atrocities committed by Russian forces in Ukraine. Alexey Savichev, 49, a former Russian convict recruited by Wagner last September, told the Guardian in a telephone interview that he participated in summary executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war during his six months of fighting in eastern Ukraine. “We were told not to take any prisoners, and just shoot them on the spot,” he said. In one instance, while fighting near the eastern Ukrainian city of Soledar last autumn, Savichev said he participated in the killings of 20 Ukrainian soldiers who were surrounded. “We sprayed them with our bullets,” he said. “It is war and I do not regret a single thing I did there. If I could, I would go back.” Savichev said that in another episode, with other Wagner fighters he had killed “several dozen” injured Ukrainian prisoners of war by “tossing grenades” into the ditch where they were held near the city Bakhmut in January. “We would torture soldiers too, there weren’t any rules,” he said. ‘I do not regret a thing’: Wagner fighter admits torturing Ukrainian troops and PoWs Read more\n\nUpdated at 01.43 EDT\n\n1h ago 01.31 EDT South Korea signals willingness to supply Ukraine with drones South Korea might extend its support for Ukraine beyond humanitarian and economic aid if it comes under a large-scale civilian attack, President Yoon Suk Yeol said, signalling a shift in his stance against arming Ukraine for the first time. In an interview with Reuters ahead of his state visit to the US next week, Yoon said his government has been exploring how to help defend and rebuild Ukraine, just as South Korea received international assistance during the 1950-53 Korean war. “If there is a situation the international community cannot condone, such as any large-scale attack on civilians, massacre or serious violation of the laws of war, it might be difficult for us to insist only on humanitarian or financial support,” Yoon said. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters It was the first time that Seoul suggested a willingness to provide weapons to Ukraine, more than a year after ruling out the possibility of lethal aid. A key US ally and major producer of artillery ammunition, South Korea has so far tried to avoid antagonising Russia due to its companies operating there and Moscow’s influence over North Korea, despite mounting pressure from western countries for weapons supply. “I believe there won’t be limitations to the extent of the support to defend and restore a country that’s been illegally invaded both under international and domestic law,” Yoon said. “However, considering our relationship with the parties engaged in the war and developments in the battlefield, we will take the most appropriate measures.”\n\n\n\n2h ago 01.10 EDT Lula condemns “violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity” by Russia Constance Malleret Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned the “violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity” by Russia and again called for mediation to end the war, as he came under fire for his previous comments on the conflict. Speaking at a lunch on Tuesday with Romanian president Klaus Iohannis, Lula said a group of neutral nations must come together to help broker peace between Russia and Ukraine. Lula faced criticism from the US over comments he made over the weekend that they were prolonging the fighting by supplying arms to Ukraine. Earlier on Tuesday, Ukraine’s government also criticised Lula for his efforts to broker a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow, and invited the Brazilian leader to visit the war-torn country and see for himself the consequences of the Russian invasion: Ukraine criticises Brazil’s peace efforts and invites Lula to see invasion’s effects Read more\n\n\n\n2h ago 01.00 EDT Ukraine and the UN are causing difficulties with inspections of ships moving grain from Ukrainian ports and the registration of new vessels, the RIA news agency cites the Russian foreign ministry as saying today.

                    "snippet": "“I killed children with [my own] hands,” Azmat Uldarov said in the video | Roman Pilipey/EPA-EFE\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.\n\nKYIV — Two former commanders of the Russian paramilitary organization known as the Wagner group claim they killed more than 20 Ukrainian children and teens in Bakhmut and the Donetsk region, in video interviews posted by a Russian human rights organization.\n\nDuring the hourlong video, ex-Wagner commanders Azmat Uldarov and Alexey Savichev recount details of various killings, including using explosives to blow up pits with more than 50 wounded prisoners and killing their own compatriots who refused to continue with the invasion. These incidents, which apparently took place in Soledar in the Donetsk region and Bakhmut in February this year, have not yet been independently verified.\n\nIn the video, the former Wagner pair also told Vladimir Osechkin — head of Gulagu.net, the Russian human rights group that published the video, currently operating in exile in France — how the group killed dozens of civilians during the clearing of residential buildings in Bakhmut and Soledar.\n\nThe two ex-commanders of the “PMC Wagner” division said that Yevgeny Prigozhin, chief financier of the mercenaries, personally gave orders for shootings and killings, as well as approving the cruel methods that Osechkin likened to terrorism in a Facebook post.\n\nOsechkin said the two fighters, both in Russia, had spoken to him over the course of a week in video calls. Osechkin published supporting documents and photos as proof that both apparently indeed spent up to six months fighting in Ukraine, returning home to Russia with medals and money.\n\nAccording to their statements, they spoke out due to the inhumane conditions and torture they had to endure themselves, and now seek to tell the truth about Wagner’s crimes in Ukraine, against Ukrainians and even its own recruits.\n\n“I killed children with [my own] hands,” Uldarov said in the video. “As we entered Soledar and Bakhmut, we got the order to destroy everyone: men, women, children, elderly. She was screaming, a little girl, don’t know if she was 5 or 6. And I shot her. A controlled shot [in the head].”\n\nAfter their accounts became public, Prigozhin denied Wagner fighters ever killed children or civilians. And both former fighters started getting threats, according to Osechkin.\n\nTheir testimonies come as Prigozhin seems to be returning to favor with Russian President Vladimir Putin after an unspoken feud lasting months sparked by Prigozhin’s criticism of the Russian defense ministry and his bragging about the Wagner group being more effective than regular Russian forces on the battlefield.\n\n“Prigozhin is seemingly regaining some favor with Putin, likely as a result of the Russian conventional military’s inability to accomplish the tasks Putin had set for it during the winter offensive in Donbas,” the Institute for the Study of War think tank reported in its latest update on Ukraine.\n\n“Wagner forces appear to be receiving reinforcements, ammunition, and political recognition — which is a stark deviation from the Kremlin’s previous efforts to expend Wagner forces and Prigozhin in Bakhmut since at least January 2023.” Over the winter, Prigozhin complained that the defense ministry did not allow him to recruit more prisoners and was not giving enough shells for Wagner forces.\n\nUldarov and Savichev were recruited from Russian prisons under the Prigozhin-Putin prisoners’ recruitment to war in Ukraine program, called “Project K.” Putin had pardoned the former convicts.\n\nIn an hour-long video, ex-Wagner commanders Azmat Uldarov and Alexey Savichev recount details of various killings, including civilians | YURIY DYACHYSHYN/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War has reported that Putin personally tried to make peace between the Russian defense ministry and Prigozhin. Yet it is still not clear to what extent he trusts Prigozhin, experts from the think tank point out.\n\nUkrainian prosecutors have started an investigation based on the Wagner fighters’ testimonies.\n\nLast week, a video emerged online of a Wagner mercenary supposedly decapitating a Ukrainian prisoner of war. Although the video has not been independently verified, this incident is also being investigated. Uldarov said the things he did and witnessed in Bakhmut and Soledar constituted even more horrible images.",

                    "snippet": "CNN —\n\nA Russian man who said he had killed children and other civilians while serving with the Wagner private military company in Ukraine appears to have recanted the claim, suggesting he was blackmailed into making it.\n\nAzamat Uldarov, a former convict, made his retraction in a video call with Russian news agency RIA-FAN. It’s unclear if there were any conditions to the interview.\n\nHe and another former convict, Alexey Savichev, previously gave long and rambling interviews to Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, saying they were among the tens of thousands of Wagner fighters recruited from Russian jails to fight in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking with Gulagu founder Vladimir Osechkin, Uldarov said he shot and killed a young girl, calling it “a management decision.”\n\n“I wasn’t allowed to let anyone out alive, because my command was to kill anything in my way,” he said, estimating that the girl was five or six years old.\n\nIn his interview with RIA-FAN – which is associated with Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin – Uldarov said he was drunk when he gave the interview, and alleged that Osechkin had blackmailed him about his time in prison.\n\nAsked by RIA-FAN: “They made you say what you said in the video, correct?” Uldarov replied: “Not only correct, it’s [expletive] correct. I had to say it because I had no choice.”\n\n“I said whatever I was told to say,” Uldarov then said.\n\n“Prigozhin is a great guy,” he added, giving a thumbs up. “He saved our lives.”\n\nHe also claimed – without specifying who – that “they have a video of me,” adding: “They are exploiting me, using my past life and my previous conviction.”\n\nThe call appeared to end with Uldarov saying: “What was said there was said under dictation. Is this enough? Have you got enough?”\n\nBut Gulagu’s Osechkin, who is based in France, told CNN he stood by the content of his interviews with the two men, citing Uldarov’s retraction as proof of how quickly dissenting voices are silenced in Russia.\n\nOsechkin also claimed that both interviewees, Uldarov and Savichev, had been threatened with murder if they didn’t retract their statements to him. Savichev told Gulagu that his unit was ordered to kill any men 15 years old or older.\n\nWagner has been seeking Savichev for the past 24 hours, according to Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nSavichev “must get in touch with the Wagner PMC call center, and I guarantee that he will not be persecuted, neither judicially nor otherwise. He must get in touch with the Wagner PMC call center and explain why he provided this falsehood, who is behind it, how he was blackmailed and whether he was given any other objectives,” Prighozhin said in a statement on social media app Telegram.\n\n“Get in touch with the Wagner PMC call center, come, tell us everything. I guarantee that you will leave safe and sound,” he added.\n\nIn another statement, Prigozhin said that according to “information we are receiving from convicts and former convicts, a group of people including former convicts and Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) employees, are actively cooperating with foreign groups including Gulagu.net.”\n\nPrigozhin claimed: “This group collects compromising material on convicts and former convicts,” and he suggested that they might react by committing “quite major unlawful acts as a result of their recruitment, such as assassination of various persons protecting the interests of the Russian Federation, acts of sabotage including in frontline areas, and acts of sabotage and terrorism in the Russian Federation.”\n\nOsechkin refuted the allegation and told CNN he believed Prigozhin is doing his best to avoid criminal responsibility for Wagner fighters’ conduct.",

Austin III is scheduled to meet with officials in Sweden on Wednesday and then to lead an international meeting in Germany on Friday to coordinate aid to Ukraine, as Kyiv presses for more weapons to fight Russian invaders in advance of an offensive that Ukrainian and Western officials say is in the offing.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky expressed frustration on Sunday over the delays in getting more arms to Ukraine’s forces, which have been in pitched battle against its outsized opponent for more than a year. The eastern city of Bakhmut, where fighting has raged for 10 months, has been a particularly bloody battleground for both sides.\n\n“Every time we hear that the promised supply of weapons is delayed, every time there are doubts about the type of weapons for Ukraine, about the range or other quality characteristics — every time it means that Ukrainian soldiers are giving their lives,” he said in his nightly address to the nation on Monday.\n\nMr. Austin met on Monday with the British defense secretary, Ben Wallace, in Washington. Mr. Wallace projected optimism about Ukraine’s battlefield “momentum,” but cautioned that the war was likely to endure into next year. Mr. Austin is scheduled to meet with his Swedish counterpart, Pal Jonson, on Wednesday. The Pentagon said the discussions would include “security-related topics of mutual interest and delivering more arms to Ukraine.” It was unclear if that would include Sweden’s stalled bid to join NATO. The country neighbors Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, and the two joined together to submit bids for full NATO membership last year, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sweden, however, was left on the sidelines last month, when Turkey’s Parliament gave the alliance’s last necessary approval to Finland, but withheld it from Sweden, because the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, accused the country of harboring Kurdish figures he considers terrorists. On Friday, Mr. Austin will lead talks at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany with officials from more than 40 nations, a collective known as the Ukraine Contact Group. The group has met regularly at the base for the past year to discuss and coordinate military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. Those talks will likely focus on sending more arms to Ukraine, which has said for months that troops are starved for ammunition and using artillery shells faster than its allies can produce and supply. The claims were corroborated by the leaked American intelligence documents that began circulating widely this month. Mr. Austin spoke with Oleksii Reznikov, the Ukrainian defense minister, on Monday to “discuss priorities” ahead of the meeting in Ramstein, according to a statement from the Defense Department.\n\nShow more",

No casualties have been reported and firefighters were working at the scene, he said.\n\nRodion Miroshnik, one of the Russian-imposed officials in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, has posted to Telegram to report that the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka, on the left-bank of the River Dniepr in the Kherson region, is under fire from Ukrainian forces. Citing the city administration, he writes “The whole city is under fire. There are already wounded.”\n\nA former Wagner mercenary has admitted to killing and torturing dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war, in one of the most detailed first-person accounts of atrocities committed by Russian forces in Ukraine. Alexey Savichev, 49, a former Russian convict recruited by Wagner last September, told the Guardian in a telephone interview that he participated in summary executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war during his six months of fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n\nSouth Korea might extend its support for Ukraine beyond humanitarian and economic aid if it comes under a large-scale civilian attack, President Yoon Suk Yeol said, signalling a shift in his stance against arming Ukraine for the first time.\n\nBrazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned the “violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity” by Russia and again called for mediation to end the war, as he came under fire for his previous comments on the conflict. Speaking at a lunch on Tuesday with Romanian president Klaus Iohannis, Lula said a group of neutral nations must come together to help broker peace between Russia and Ukraine. Lula faced criticism from the US over comments he made over the weekend that they were prolonging the fighting by supplying arms to Ukraine.\n\nUkraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited Ukrainian troops on Tuesday in Avdiivka, Donetsk region, his office have said. Zelenskiy listened to commanders’ reports on the battlefield situation and gave awards to soldiers, it said.\n\nZelenskiy and US House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy held a phone call on Tuesday in which they discussed Ukraine’s need for weapons as well as increasing sanctions pressure on Russia. On Twitter, Zelenskiy said he thanked McCarthy for bipartisan support in Congress for Ukraine.\n\nA Moscow court Tuesday rejected an appeal from US journalist Evan Gershkovich to be freed from pre-trial detention, meaning he will stay in a former KGB prison until at least 29 May while a spying case against him is investigated. Gershkovich denies the espionage charges.\n\nVladimir Putin appeared to make a rare visit to a military headquarters in Russian-occupied Ukraine in an area where his troops are bracing themselves for an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks. Video put out by the Kremlin on Tuesday showed the Russian president stepping off a military helicopter and then being driven to a military headquarters in southern Ukraine.\n\nThe G7 has criticised Russia’s threat to station nuclear weapons in Belarus, promising to intensify sanctions on Moscow for its war on neighbouring Ukraine. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko held a meeting with the Russian-installed head of Ukraine’s Donetsk region on Tuesday, the state-run Belta news agency reported.\n\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will discuss the Ukraine Black Sea grain export deal with UN Secretary-General António Guterres in New York next week, just weeks before the pact could expire unless Russian demands regarding its own exports are met.\n\nPoland nnounced plans to install thousands of cameras and motion sensors along its border with Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave to prevent what Warsaw says are illegal migrant crossings orchestrated by Moscow. Polish interior minister Mariusz Kaminski said the system would join a barbed wire fence being built on the 200-kilometre frontier.\n\n.\n\nThe maker of Sweden’s Absolut vodka has said it is ceasing all exports to Russia after calls to boycott the brand flared up in Sweden and on social media, Agence France-Presse reported.",

The newspaper and the Biden administration have condemned the reporter’s arrest, the first detention of a U.S. journalist on spying charges since the days of the Cold War.\n\nMr. Gershkovich has been held since March after Russia’s Federal Security Service detained him in Yekaterinburg, alleging he was caught seeking classified information about a Russian arms factory.\n\nAppearing in public for the first time in weeks on Tuesday, Mr. Gershkovich could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted, the Associated Press reported.\n\nRussian forces are bracing for an expected Ukrainian counterattack in the coming days, but Mr. Putin was not seen with his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, or Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff and lead commander for the Ukrainian operation, in the video released by the Kremlin.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, briefing reporters Tuesday, hinted that the shaky security situation inside Ukraine was partly to blame.\n\n“Gathering together is a big risk,” he said.\n\nMr. Putin’s government formally annexed four eastern and southern border regions of Ukraine last fall, a move widely rejected by the international community. But Russian forces have struggled to expand beyond those regions and even lost some territory in recent months to advancing Ukrainian forces.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been a far more frequent presence on the front lines in Ukraine‘s disputed Donbas region, and made another visit Tuesday to talk with Ukrainian troops and get a briefing from local commanders in Avdiivka, Donetsk, his office said.\n\nAvdiivka is just 40 miles from Bakhmut, the ravaged city that has become the focal point of fierce fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in recent months.\n\nPosting on Twitter, Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Mr. Zelenskyy, said mockingly that Mr. Putin was returning to “enjoy the crimes of his minions for the last time.”\n\n“Putin‘s degradation is impressive,” Mr. Podolyak tweeted.\n\nBut Mr. Peskov described the trip, which was not announced in advance, as “the routine work of the commander in chief,” according to the official TASS news agency.\n\n“Now the president visits the new regions more frequently,” Mr. Peskov said. “Naturally, he inspects headquarters, receives operational information on the spot about the progress of the special military operation. … This is how he works.”\n\n• David R.

                    "snippet": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday visited two regions in Ukraine that Moscow claims to have annexed, meeting with military commanders in both Kherson and Luhansk, according to the Kremlin.\n\nPutin met with commanders at the headquarters of the Dnepr Group of Forces in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson and the Vostok National Guard in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine to discuss the Russian war effort in the regions.\n\nMoscow formally annexed Kherson, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk last fall, after a series of local referendums that were denounced as shams by the U.S. and its Western allies. However, Russian forces have only partly controlled the regions since the announcement.\n\nPutin’s visit was his second in two months to the annexed regions, after he traveled to Mariupol in the Donetsk region last month, Reuters noted.\n\n“Now the president visits the new regions more frequently, naturally, he inspects headquarters, receives operational information on the spot about the progress of the special military operation,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS. “This is vital for the commander-in-chief, this is how he works.”\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, a senior advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, described Putin’s visit in a tweet on Tuesday as a “’special tour’ of the mass murders” in the annexed regions.",

                    "snippet": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has met his commanders in two regions of Ukraine that Moscow claims to have annexed, while Russian forces stepped up heavy artillery bombardments and air strikes on the devastated eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had attended a military command meeting in Ukraine's southern Kherson region and visited a national guard headquarters in eastern Luhansk on Monday.\n\nPutin heard reports from commanders of the airborne forces and the Dnieper army group as well as other senior officers who briefed him on the situation in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south.\n\nNeither De fence Minister Sergei Shoigu nor Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov joined Putin on his trip as a security precaution, the Kremlin said.\n\nA senior Ukrainian presidential aide, Mykhailo Podolyak, took to Twitter to mock Putin's trip as a \"'special tour' of the mass murders author in the occupied and ruined territories to enjoy the crimes of his minions for the last time.\"\n\nKyiv and the West accuse Russian forces of committing war crimes in occupied Ukrainian territory, which Moscow denies.\n\nKherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk are the four regions that Putin proclaimed annexed last September following what Ukraine said were sham referendums. Russian forces only partly control the four regions.\n\nRussian troops retreated from Kherson city, the regional capital, last November, and have been reinforcing their positions on the opposite bank of the Dnipro River in anticipation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nWhile numerous Western leaders have made their way to Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy since Russian forces invaded 14 months ago, Putin has rarely visited parts of Ukraine under Russian control.\n\nLast month, he visited Crimea – annexed by Russia in 2014 – and the southeastern city of Mariupol in Donetsk region.\n\nA Russian winter offensive failed to make much progress and its troops have been bogged down in a series of battles in the east and south, where advances have been incremental and come at a huge cost to both sides.\n\nFighting has raged in and around Bakhmut in Donetsk region for months, with Ukrainian forces holding out despite regular claims by Russia to have taken the mining city.\n\n\"Currently, the enemy is increasing the activity of heavy artillery and the number of air strikes, turning the city into ruins,\" the commander of Ukraine's ground forces, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nBakhmut's capture could provide a stepping stone for Russia to advance on two bigger cities it has long coveted in the Donetsk region – Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.\n\nThe head of the Wagner mercenary group, which has spearheaded Russia's attempt to take Bakhmut, said this month that its fighters controlled more than 80% of the city. Ukraine's military has denied this.\n\nRussia says its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, launched on Feb. 24 last year was necessary to protect its security against what it sees as a hostile and aggressive West.\n\nUkraine and its Western allies say Russia is waging an unprovoked war aimed at grabbing territory.\n\nA meeting of Group of Seven foreign ministers in Japan condemned on Tuesday a Russian plan to station shorter-range, so-called tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, a Moscow ally which borders Ukraine.\n\nIt was the first time Russia had said it would station nuclear weapons on the territory of another country since the end of the Cold War three decades ago.\n\nIn a communique at the end of a three-day meeting in Japan, G-7 foreign ministers said: \"Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and its threat to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus are unacceptable.\"\n\n\"Any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences,\" they said.\n\nThe G-7 groups the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, and Canada, which have all imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has killed tens of thousands of people, leveled cities, forced millions from their homes, and shaken up the global security order, including by prompting Russia to strengthen ties with non-Western actors such as China.\n\nRussia's De fence Minister Shoigu told his Chinese counterpart Li Shangu during talks in Moscow on Tuesday that their countries' military cooperation was a \"stabilizing\" force in the world and helped to reduce the chances of conflict.\n\nLi said his trip aimed to show the world that China firmly intends to strengthen its strategic cooperation with Russia, the TASS news agency reported.\n\nBeijing has refrained from criticizing Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin also praised on Tuesday Brazil's efforts to mediate in the Ukraine conflict. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has drawn U.S. criticism for suggesting that the West had been \"encouraging\" war by arming Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese defense ministry said it had scrambled a jet fighter in response to what it said were Russian aircraft gathering information over seas near Japan. Earlier, Russia said two of its strategic bombers – which are capable of carrying nuclear warheads – had conducted patrol flights over the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea in Russia's Far East.",

                    "snippet": "KYIV, Ukraine >> Russian President Vladimir Putin visited command posts of his forces fighting in Ukraine for the second time in two months, officials said Tuesday, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made his latest trip near the front line.\n\nThe visits — on different days and in different provinces — sought to stiffen the resolve of soldiers as the war approaches its 14th month and as Kyiv readies a possible counteroffensive with Western-supplied weapons.\n\nSome of the most significant of those weapons appeared to have recently arrived in Ukraine. Germany’s official federal government website on Tuesday listed a Patriot surface-to-air guided missile system as among the military items delivered within the past week to Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has been pressing for Patriots and other air defense systems from its allies for months, and Germany’s appeared to be the first to have arrived. Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat declined to confirm Tuesday that a Patriot is in Ukraine, local media outlet RBC-Ukraine reported, while stating that receiving the missiles would be a landmark event, allowing Ukrainians to knock down Russian targets at a greater distance.\n\nElsewhere, Kremlin video showed Putin arriving by helicopter at the command post of Russian forces in southern Ukraine’s Kherson province, then flying to the headquarters of the Russian National Guard in Luhansk province, in the country’s east. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the visits took place Monday.\n\nDressed in a dark suit, Putin attended briefings with his military brass on both of his stops. The locations of the military headquarters weren’t disclosed, making it impossible to assess how close they were to the front line. Nor was it possible independently to verify the video’s authenticity.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zelenskyy made his latest trip to visit units in Avdiivka, an eastern city in Donetsk province where fierce battles are taking place. He heard first-hand reports about fighting and handed out awards.\n\nZelenskyy’s visits to areas feeling the brunt of Russia’s full-scale invasion gathered pace last month as he shuttled across the country, often by train. As with Putin, the Ukrainian president’s wartime trips usually aren’t publicized until afterward.\n\nWhile official coverage of Putin’s trip showed him in mostly formal and ceremonious settings, Zelenskyy’s office issued photos showing the Ukrainian president taking selfies with soldiers, eating cake with them and drinking out of paper cups.\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has become largely deadlocked, with heavy fighting in the east, particularly around the Donestk province city of Bakhmut, which for 8½ months has seen the longest and bloodiest battle so far.\n\nRussia illegally annexed Kherson, Luhansk, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia provinces in September, following local referendums that Ukraine and the West denounced as shams. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak was scathing in his criticism of Putin’s trip, accusing him of “degradation” and being the author of “mass murders” in the war.\n\nLarge parts of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, as well as some areas of Luhansk province, have remained under Ukrainian control. In November, Russian forces ceded territory in Kherson province, including the region’s namesake capital.\n\nIn a related development, the Moscow-appointed governor of the occupied part of Donetsk province, Denis Pushilin, went to the Belarus capital of Minsk and won pledges of support from President Alexander Lukashenko, a Putin ally.\n\n“The Kremlin forces Minsk to get involved in the war more actively in order to pressure Ukraine,” Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich said in a telephone interview. “It is clear that Pushilin’s visit to Minsk has been synchronized with Putin’s trip to the occupied Ukrainian regions and aims to show that the Belarusian threat hasn’t gone away.”\n\nDuring his visits, Putin congratulated the military divisions on Orthodox Easter, which was celebrated Sunday, and presented them with icons. Speaking to senior officers at the Kherson headquarters, Putin handed them a copy of an Orthodox icon he said belonged to a 19th century Russian general.\n\nThe senior officers present at the meetings reflected which ones were currently in favor with Putin. Col. Gen. Mikhail Teplinsky, the chief of Russia’s airborne troops, was among the top generals at the Kherson base.\n\nTeplinsky, a career officer who rose from lieutenant to become chief of the elite military branch, is known for being popular with his troops. Last fall, however, he was temporarily relieved of his position amid a spat with the military brass. He was restored to the job this year, and his meeting with Putin indicated he was back in favor.\n\nA senior officer who greeted Putin in the Luhansk region, Col. Gen. Alexander Lapin, also was relieved of his duties as commanding officer in northeastern Ukraine after he was blamed for a hasty Russian pullback from parts of Kharkiv province in the face of a Ukrainian counteroffensive in September. Lapin was later named as chief of staff of the ground forces, and his meeting with Putin signaled he had the president’s trust.\n\nPutin’s and Pushilin’s trips came as Ukraine is preparing a new counteroffensive to reclaim occupied territories, possibly using the newly arrived Patriot.\n\nIn addition to Germany, the United States and Netherlands have pledged to provide Patriots, and a group of 65 Ukrainian soldiers trained in Oklahoma last month on how to use them.\n\nThe Patriot is a surface-to-air guided missile system first deployed in the 1980s that can target aircraft, cruise missiles and shorter-range ballistic missiles. A Patriot missile battery typically includes six mobile launchers, a mobile radar, a power generator and an engagement control center. Zelenskyy has said Ukraine needs at least 20 Patriot batteries.\n\nUkrainian officials have said they’re depleting Russian forces in eastern Ukraine while preparing for a counteroffensive.\n\nMeanwhile, at least three civilians were killed and 11 wounded in Ukraine between Monday and Tuesday, according to Zelenskyy’s office. Most of the casualties occurred in the Donbas, the eastern region made up of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, the office said. Six people were wounded in artillery fire in the city of Kherson.\n\nIn another in a series of possible cross-border attacks into Russia, a drone a Russian official said was sent from Ukraine hit a military office in the Bryansk town of Novozybkov. Gov. Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram that the building was damaged and no one was hurt. Ukrainian officials, in keeping with past practice, didn’t comment on the incident.\n\n———\n\nAssociated Press Writer Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, and Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv contributed.",

                    "snippet": "A former Wagner mercenary has admitted to killing and torturing dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war, in one of the most detailed first-person accounts of atrocities committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\nAlexey Savichev, 49, a former Russian convict recruited by Wagner last September, told the Guardian in a telephone interview that he participated in summary executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war during his six months of fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n\n“We were told not to take any prisoners, and just shoot them on the spot,” he said.\n\nIn one instance, while fighting near the eastern Ukrainian city of Soledar last autumn, Savichev said he participated in the killings of 20 Ukrainian soldiers who were surrounded. “We sprayed them with our bullets,” he said. “It is war and I do not regret a single thing I did there. If I could, I would go back.”\n\nSavichev said that in another episode, with other Wagner fighters he had killed “several dozen” injured Ukrainian PoWs by “tossing grenades” into the ditch where they were held near the city Bakhmut in January. “We would torture soldiers too, there weren’t any rules,” he said.\n\nSavichev’s account was first published on Monday by the Gulagu.net rights group in an hour an 17 minute-long video, where he appeared alongside another former Wagner fighter, identified as Azamat Uldarov, who also said he had killed civilians, including children, during the battle for Bakhmut.\n\nUldarov said his fellow mercenaries in one instance killed a group of people who had taken shelter in the basement of a nine-floor block of flats in Bakhmut, including a young girl. “She was screaming, she was a little kid, she was five or six and I shot her, a kill shot. I wasn’t allowed to let anyone out, you understand?” Uldarov told Vladimir Osechkin, the head of the Gulagu.net rights group. He could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Guardian cannot independently verify either man’s harrowing claim but has seen Russian penal documents showing that Savichev, who was a convicted murderer, was released from a prison in Voronezh, a city in south-west Russia, on a presidential pardon on 12 September.\n\nAn aerial view of the destroyed centre of Bakhmut on 26 March. Photograph: Libkos/AP\n\nWagner has recruited tens of thousands of inmates, including convicted murderers, to fight in eastern Ukraine. They were offered freedom if they survived a near-suicidal six-month stint, one Savichev completed on 12 March.\n\nSavichev also provided the Guardian with photographs of two medals that he said he received for the battle of Soledar, a town in eastern Ukraine that Wagner troops captured in early January.\n\nHis testimony appears to contribute towards a mounting body of evidence that sheds light on the war crimes committed by Russian soliders in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this month, two videos emerged showing Russian soldiers apparently beheading Ukrainian prisoners of war. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which has not been verified by the Guardian. “How easily these beasts kill. We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers,” he said.\n\nResponding to the interview published by Gulagu Net, Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said those responsible should be punished. “Confession is not enough. There must be a punishment. Tough and fair. And it will definitely be,” Yermak wrote on Twitter.\n\nSince the start of the war, a number of Russian soldiers, including one former Wagner convict, have fled abroad and described witnessing Russian war crimes, but Savichev’s testimony is a rare account of a former Wagner soldier still in Russia.\n\nSavichev said he has been on the run since giving his first interview on Monday and had received “multiple” threats.\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman driving along the frontline outside Soledar in March, where Wagner mercenaries we also deployed. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, head of Wagner, said the account of the two former Wagner soldiers was a “flagrant lie” and that Wagner fighters “have never touched and do not touch” children.\n\nSavichev said he feared he would face the same consequence as Yevgeny Nuzhin, a convicted murderer recruited by Wagner who surrendered to Ukrainian forces but was later handed over to Russia and executed. “I was with Wagner, and know what they can do to those who speak out,” Savichev said. “I understand I could die soon. I just don’t want my death to be violent.”\n\nHe said he had witnessed multiple summary killings of other Wagner fighters accused by their commanders of disobeying orders or of breaking the “code of conduct”, including regarding the consumption of alcohol.\n\nSavichev said he joined Wagner after Prigozhin visited his IK-12 colony in Voronezh last September. “Prigozhin came to our prison and said that he was looking for killers. He said the regular army was full of wussies who couldn’t get the job done.”\n\nHe said he was accepted into Wagner despite his HIV diagnosis – Russia’s regular army does not permit soldiers with serious diseases to join its ranks. “They don’t care if you have HIV or hepatitis, as long as you can kill,” he said.\n\nAccording to Savichev’s account, just over 100 prisoners from IK-12 in Voronezh signed up to fight with Wagner. After a two-week training course, he was sent to the frontlines, fighting first in Soledar and, after the town’s capture, in Bakhmut.\n\nHe said he was placed in small units of four that were used as “storming troops”, who were ordered to launch extremely dangerous assaults on Ukraine’s positions. He estimated that of the 100 prisoners recruited from his prison, only 21 returned alive. According to western estimates, Wagner has suffered more than 30,000 casualties, mostly former convicts, since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine last February.\n\n“We were basically just meat for our commanders, I still don’t know how I survived,” Savichev said. “No one gave a shit about us.”",

                    "snippet": "Russian soldiers appear to admit to killing Ukrainian children\n\nWagner Group mercenaries have admitted to “shooting a five-year-old girl in the head”, executing Ukrainian civilians in their dozens and killing people with sledgehammers in a tell-all interview. Azamat Uldarov and Alexei Savichev, both ex-convicts pardoned by Vladimir Putin, told Gulagu.net they had been personally ordered by Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin to slaughter civilians and refrain from taking prisoners.\n\nThe shocking claims have led to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office opening up an investigation as the country is still recovering from a horrific video published last week purporting to show a Wagner Group soldier beheading a POW. Azamat Uldarov, an ex-convict from the Penitentiary colony № 13 of the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service, told the Russian outlet that he had killed a five or six-year-old girl when he entered Soledar and Bakhmut. Visibly drunk and smoking on camera, the Wagnerite also claimed he was instructed to “kill everyone - women, men, pensioners and children”. He said: “I executed the order with this hand, I killed the children. You understand, by order. The fact that we ... We were given the command to wipe out and destroy everyone. “We went 150 Wagnerites and killed everyone - women, men, pensioners and children, in particular small - five-year-olds.”\n\nPapers published on social media show Uldarov’s presidential pardon documents\n\nHe added that he “cleared” the basement of a nine-storey building in Bakhmut with roughly 400 people inside, including 40 people. Uldarov also admitted that the “Wagnerians” do not take prisoners and practise killing Ukrainian soldiers. He said: “Mainly with a knife. We cut the throat. We film it. When Prigozhin said sledgehammer, we took a sledgehammer and killed with a sledgehammer. This is his method. He is a terrible person.” He claimed this took place in March 2023. Alexei Savichev, an ex-convict from the Penitentiary colony № 1 of the Voronezh Oblast, who was pardoned by Putin’s decree of 02 September 2022, also admitted to committing atrocities.

He said: “Peaceful residents were coming out. And there was an order: everyone, who is 15 (years old) and older - to shoot everyone at once without words. 20-24 people were shot, 10 of them were 15-year-old and 17-year-old teenagers.” Both mercenaries were ex-commanders of Wagner units, according to the documents provided, who spoke to Gulagu.net founder Vladimir Osechkin from within Russia. Savichev said that the Wagner fighters were threatened with death if they spoke to journalists.

                    "snippet": "As Russia's war on Ukraine grinds on toward the 15-month mark, both sides are expected to launch new offensives, and both sides have apparently suffered shortages of key weaponry. Recently leaked Pentagon documents appear to show Ukraine running dangerously low on the air defense rounds it has used to stop thousands of Russian rockets, missiles and exploding drones from reaching their targets.\n\nOn the other side of the front lines, the leaked papers suggest Russia's special forces have been decimated, as wave after wave of soldiers have been thrown into the fight with little gained in return.\n\nThe Ukrainians will soon get an advanced U.S. Patriot air defense system to help them fend off the invasion, and there's more weaponry on the way from Europe — everything from heavy main battle tanks to machine gun ammunition.\n\nUkrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Resnikov recently gloated in social media videos over the first big tanks sent from Europe to help his country fend off Russia's invasion, climbing aboard a British Challenger 2, part of the first batch of modern \"main battle tanks\" (MBTs) to be handed over to Ukraine's armed forces. They were promised along with dozens of German-made Leopard 2 tanks and, later this year, American M1 Abrams tanks.\n\nRussia, however, may be struggling to get modern war machines to the front lines, and has pulled some very, very old tanks out of deep storage, seemingly to bolster its ground forces in Ukraine.\n\nWhile Ukrainian forces train on modern Western weapons, Russian tank crews appear set to take delivery of machines driven by their fathers' — or even their grandfathers' generations.\n\nLast month, an online post by the Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT), a Russian organization that's investigated and documented Russia's military actions in Ukraine since the first invasion in 2014, showed what it said were mothballed, Soviet-era T-54 and T-55 tanks being loaded onto trains and rolling off storage bases.\n\nIt sparked a flurry of speculation, and while Russia's military hasn't commented on the movement of the tanks, more sophisticated but still-old Soviet T-62 tanks have already been taken from the same storage location, brought to workshops to be refurbished, and then deployed in Ukraine. CIT noted in its late-March report that the train transport spotted that month was the first known instance of the older T-54s and T-55s being pulled out of storage.\n\nAn image published in late March 2023 by the exiled Russian Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) organization shows what the CIT says are Soviet-era T-54 and T-55 tanks rolling away from a storage base on train cars. Conflict Intelligence Team\n\nWhile official sources have said nothing, pro-Kremlin military analysts who feature regularly on Russia's state-run media outlets made no attempt to downplay the apparent resurrection of the Soviet military hardware.\n\nYuri Netkachev, a retired lieutenant general who once commanded a tank battalion, told the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper that the T-54 and T-55 tanks were \"in demand to continue the special operation, because they have a significant ammunition load.\"\n\nWith Ukraine's armed forces claiming to have destroyed more than 3,600 Russian tanks since the full-scale invasion began on February 24, 2022, Netkachev stressed the sheer quantity of old Soviet tanks in Russian storage — as many as 10,000, he claimed — as a potential battlefield advantage.\n\n\"We see these tanks on the railway platforms, and this indicates that crews of four people per vehicle have been trained for all of them. The tanks have been modernized, the sights on them have been adjusted and can be replaced, and also for each of them there is sufficient ammunition, which will be replenished in a timely manner,\" claimed Netkachev, suggesting they would most likely be used to hold ground, rather than attempt to gain it as part of a \"main striking force.\"\n\nThe \"Beast From the East\"\n\nEntering service just after the Second World War, in 1948, the T-54 was the original Cold War tank. Dubbed the \"Beast From the East\" during that East-West standoff, the tank represented a massive leap in Soviet design. It was followed by the introduction of the T-55 a few years later, and both were produced in huge quantities.\n\nA file image published in late March 2023 by the exiled Russian Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) organization shows what the CIT says is a Soviet-era T-55 tank in open storage on a Russian base. Handout/Conflict Intelligence Team\n\nWith estimates suggesting as many as 60,000 of the machines were built in the USSR, it became one of the most widely used tanks in the world, having been exported to about 50 countries. They have been and are still used by countless armies and militias in conflicts ranging from the jungles of Vietnam to the plains of Africa and the mountains of Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, despite still being in production into the early 1980's it was clear by the previous decade, when they were used in the Arab-Israeli war, that the T-55 was outdated and they were eventually withdrawn from service and mothballed.\n\nUntil now, at least.\n\nWhile Netkachev and other Russian pundits likely offer realistic insight, framing the old tanks as a plentiful resource to bolster Russian forces' back lines on the battlefield, Moscow's plans for the Cold War machines have not been confirmed. They wouldn't fare well if put toe-to-toe with the latest Western MBTs, or even many of the smaller armored fighting vehicles (AFVs) now being supplied to Ukraine, as the Soviet tanks lack sufficient armor, firing range, night fighting capabilities and modern fire control systems — or the capacity to fire on the move.\n\nThose facts left CIT's analysts to write that it was \"difficult to determine the possible uses of these tanks,\" but they concluded it likely \"indicates severe issues with military vehicle supply in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nAs Russia's two tank factories reportedly struggle to produce new tanks and modernize older models under pressure from international sanctions that have constrained supplies, Russia might be banking on its significant stocks of older machinery to keep its war effort going, and even to help it drive a long-expected offensive this spring.\n\nEven if used, as Netkachev and other analysts have suggested, as almost static, indirect-fire artillery pieces behind the front lines, given the number of tanks and the quantity of shells Russia has for them, the Soviet relics could still prove deadly. Assuming, of course, that after decades in storage, they even start.",

                    "snippet": "Retired US General thinks Ukraine could regain territory in 2023\n\nThe Orthodox Church and its religious believers celebrated Easter this weekend, the event always happening after the Jewish festival of Passover unlike in the Catholic and Protestant churches. Worshippers in both Ukraine and Russia, as well as other Orthodox countries, flooded into their grand churches to remember the death and rebirth of Jesus Christ. But for those two countries in particular, the celebrations are bittersweet. While the Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox Churches have been separate since 2018, as the war in Ukraine intensifies, so too does the gap between the two faiths.\n\nTrending\n\nNow, Express.co.uk has been told that such is the gulf that a civil war could well emerge in Ukraine after Russia's invasion — a civil war based on a growing religious divide. Ever since he ordered his troops' invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has attempted to frame the war as a holy one. Only late last year did he say he was helping Ukraine to defend itself from Western \"satanism\". It is but one in a long list of reasons, many regarded as bogus, Putin has given. For decades, Ukraine's Russian-affiliated branch of the Orthodox Church was the country's only recognised church. But in 2019, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, a separate body with no ties to Russia, was given self-governing status by the head of the Orthodox church in Constantinople in Istanbul. It meant that Ukraine's estimated 30 million Orthodox believers were divided between the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) and two other Orthodox Churches, one of which is the independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church.\n\nEaster celebrations in a Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Kyiv\n\nPutin attends the Christ The Saviour Cathedral, Moscow, on April 16, to mark Easter\n\nThis is something Dr Katherine Kelaidis, Director of Research and Content at the National Hellenic Museum in Chicago, said could in the future lead to domestic unrest. The Russia expert, who has recently written a book about Putin's holy war, said there may be portions of the Orthodox population who come out the other side of the war hurt and angry with decisions made — noting how Orthodoxy in the region has for years been tied up with politics. Since the war began, reports have emerged of Russian Orthodox sermons in Russia condemning Ukraine and the West. Patriarch Kirill, the controversial head of the Russian Orthodox Church and former KGB agent, has backed Putin's war and told his followers that \"sacrifice in the course of carrying out your military duty washes away all sins.\" When asked whether this sentiment might seep into the Russian Orthodox churches in Ukraine and farther afield, Dr Kelaidis said: \"I think there is a genuine fear of a civil war in a post-war Ukraine.\" JUST IN: Air France pilot's chilling last words before jet crashed into sea\n\nPeople protest against the Russian leaning Lviv UOC church in April\n\nShe continued: \"That even if Ukraine wins, even if they drive the Russians out [something may happen]. \"Russia's ability to wage this war is fairly tenuous. I don't know what tricks Putin has up his sleeve, but if Ukraine is successful in expelling Russia from its territory, I think they could also be facing a civil war, because are there these [divisive] elements there. \"Is it the whole of the Orthodox Church of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church? Is it everyone who goes to those churches? Certainly not, because you're talking about a huge chunk of the Ukrainian population. Is it the old Russian speakers in Ukraine? Certainly not. \"But are there enough pockets of pro-Russian sentiment and of the agitators within the church, and other institutions, that you could have a civil war? Maybe.\"\n\nPatriarch Kirill (C) is an ally of Putin and was recently outed as a former KGB agent\n\nTeh Kyiv Pechersk Lavra is one of many Russian-oriented Orthodox churches in Ukraine\n\nThis month, Ukrainian investigators searched the home of Metropolitan Pavel Lebed, the leader of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra monastery in Kyiv, a branch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church that was previously loyal to the Moscow clergy. Prosecutors in Kyiv say he is suspected of inciting national and religious hatred in Ukraine, and the city has tried to evict him and his followers from the monastery. It isn't the first time he has faced such charges, having had a criminal case opened against him in 2018 \"for inciting inter-faith hatred\". Metropolitan Pavel has denied the allegations and says the Kyiv authorities have no legal grounds for evicting the monastery's monks and staff. Appearing in court in early April, he hit out at the investigation, calling it a \"political case\" and said, \"I've never been on the side of aggression\".\n\nPutin has a select few in his inner circle, with Patriarch Kirill believed to be on the periphery\n\nMetropolitan Pavel was in April accused of inciting religious hatred — and not for the first time",

While many decided to flee after Russia's invasion, the Kyiv teacher went back to her home in Chernihiv.\n\nShe didn’t sit idly by. While her country was being invaded she took one of the ultimate risks, providing her friends with the location of Russia positions and the direction of supplies and vehicles. The danger was not hypothetical. At the end of March she was discovered and taken prisoner by Russian troops. She is one of the roughly 15,000 civilians who have been held hostage by Russia, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\n\"They inspected the house and began to ask who, where, and with whom (we) talked, and on the same day they took me away with the words ‘Take warm clothes, you are coming with us,'\" she said through an interpreter.\n\nRUSSIA SEES HISTORIC POPULATION DROP SPURRING DEMOGRAPHIC CRISIS AMID WAR IN UKRAINE\n\nIt was part of a five-month hostage situation. Victoria was initially taken to a prison just north of her hometown in Chernihiv, where she remembered being treated decently by her captors. But a few days later, she was moved to a tent camp in Russia, where her captors assaulted and humiliated her.\n\nShe said her captors beat her feet with rubber batons and used an electric stun gun on her. \"They used it in different parts on the body because it does not leave any marks immediately: palms, back, and on the muscular parts of the body. At the same time, they forced me to sing their anthem.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Russians called her a \"spotter,\" a term used to describe someone who reports the positions of the invading forces. Psychological threats became part of the ritual. Day after day Russian special forces, along with others, would come into her cell threatening her with rape and mutilation. At one point she remembers being locked inside a metal closet, where a soldier threw a small piece of burning paper and threatened to incinerate her in an instant.\n\nDespite this, Victoria managed to somehow keep seeing light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\"I understood that I needed to return home, and the following phrase echoed in my head: ‘Return home as a person, not a vegetable.’\"\n\nRUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT LAUNCHES 'LARGEST EVER' PROBE INTO WAR CRIMES\n\nVictoria Andrusha is welcomed home following her capture and torture by Russian forces.

She didn’t know that Ukraine was now winning the war and that they had retaken Chernihiv, that her large family was now living in freedom, or that the country was finding a way to get her home.\n\nOne day at the end of September, a group was being moved to another camp but within a day they suddenly realized they were coming closer to the Belarusian border. The next day, her long nightmare was over.\n\nThe ordeal has changed her forever but has not prevented her from continuing on. She is now back in Kyiv, teaching math problems to her young students, not becoming \"a vegetable.\" Reflecting back on her time held captive, she doesn’t harbor resentment toward her kidnappers, but instead feels empathy.\n\n\"Everything is twisted there, I don't know, it's not that you need to change them, you don't need to eradicate something, they just need to get the right information.\" She added, \"These people are zombified, that is, they have absolutely no overall picture of the situation that is happening around them\"\n\nA Ukrainian flag waves in a heavily damaged residential area in the village of Dolyna in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, after the withdrawal of Russian troops on Sept. 24.\n\nThe trauma is something she is still working on with therapists and a psychologist, but even knowing what was to come, she has no hesitation about what she would do.\n\n\"When I was doing all of this, I didn't fully realize what the consequences could be, but if I had known that this could happen, I would have done it anyway.

The Kremlin says Putin has visited headquarters of the Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. (Pool Photo via AP)\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin visited command posts of the Kremlin’s forces fighting in Ukraine, officials said Tuesday, as the war approaches its 14th month and Kyiv readies a possible counteroffensive with Western-supplied weapons.\n\nA video released by the Kremlin and broadcast by Russian state television showed Putin arriving by helicopter at the command post of Russian forces in southern Ukraine's Kherson province and then flying to the headquarters of the Russian National Guard in Luhansk province, which is in the east.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the visits took place Monday. The trip, Putin's second in two months to Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine, represented an apparent attempt by the Russian leader to rally his troops and demonstrate his authority.\n\nDressed in a dark suit, Putin appeared to chair meetings with his military top brass during both of his stops. The locations of the military headquarters weren’t disclosed, making it impossible to assess how close they were to the front line. Nor was it possible to independently verify the authenticity of the video footage.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made his latest trip to positions near the front line to stiffen the resolve of soldiers battling Putin’s troops. Zelenskyy visited units in Avdiivka, a city in Donetsk province where fierce battles are taking place, his office said. He heard first-hand reports about the battlefield situation and handed out awards.\n\nZelenskyy’s visits to areas of his country that have felt the brunt of Russia’s full-scale invasion gathered pace last month as he shuttled across the country, often by train. As with Putin, the Ukrainian leader's wartime trips usually aren’t publicized until after he’s already left an area.\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has become largely deadlocked amid heavy fighting in the east, particularly around the Donestk province city of Bakhmut, which for 8½ months has been the stage for the longest and bloodiest battle so far.\n\nKherson and Luhansk, along with Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia provinces, were annexed illegally by Russia in September, following local referendums that Ukraine and the West denounced as shams. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak was scathing in his criticism of Putin’s trip, accusing the Russian leader of “degradation” and being the author of “mass murders” in the war.\n\nBoth then and now, large parts of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, as well as some areas of Luhansk province, have remained under Ukrainian control. In November, Russian forces ceded territory in Kherson province, including the region’s namesake capital.\n\nIn a parallel development, the Moscow-appointed governor of the occupied part of Donetsk province, Denis Pushilin, went to Minsk and won pledges of support from Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, a Putin ally.\n\nAnalysts said Pushilin’s visit was likely approved by the Kremlin and sought to remind Kyiv about the possibility of Belarus joining Russia in the war.\n\n“The Kremlin forces Minsk to get involved in the war more actively in order to pressure Ukraine with threats of Belarus joining,” said Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich, in a telephone interview. “It is clear that Pushilin’s visit to Minsk has been synchronized with Putin’s trip to the occupied Ukrainian regions and aims to show that the Belarusian threat hasn’t gone away.”\n\nIn both locations he visited, Putin congratulated the military divisions on Orthodox Easter, which was celebrated Sunday, and presented them with icons. Speaking to senior officers at the Kherson headquarters, Putin handed them a copy of an Orthodox icon he said belonged to a famous Russian general of the 19th century.\n\nThe senior officers present at the meetings reflected which ones were currently in favor with Putin. Col. Gen. Mikhail Teplinsky, the chief of Russia's airborne troops, was among the top generals at the Kherson base.\n\nTeplinsky, a career officer who rose from lieutenant to become the chief of the elite military branch, is known for being popular with his troops. However, last fall he was temporarily relieved of his position amid a spat with the top military brass.\n\nHe was restored to the job earlier this year, and his attendance at the meeting with Putin indicated that he was back in favor.\n\nA senior officer who greeted Putin in the Luhansk region, Col. Gen. Alexander Lapin, was also relieved of his duties as the commanding officer of Russian troops in Ukraine’s northeast after he was blamed for a hasty Russian pullback from parts of Kharkiv province in the face of a Ukrainian counteroffensive in September.\n\nHe was later named as chief of staff of the ground forces, and his meeting with Putin on Tuesday signaled that Lapin had the president’s trust.\n\nPutin’s trips to the military headquarters come as Ukraine is preparing for a new counteroffensive to reclaim the occupied territories. Last month, he visited the Russian-held port city of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, which was captured by Russian troops in May 2022 after two months of fierce fighting.\n\nUkrainian officials have said they’re buying time by depleting Russian forces in eastern Ukraine while preparing for a counteroffensive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has argued that if Russia wins the battle for Bakhmut, it could allow Putin to begin building international support for a deal that would require Ukraine to make unacceptable compromises to end the war.\n\nOleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told The Associated Press in an interview in Kyiv that Ukraine’s allies were helping the government to assemble the materiel needed to launch a counteroffensive, including heavy armored vehicles and ammunition.\n\nMeanwhile, at least three civilians were killed and 11 were wounded in Ukraine between Monday and Tuesday, according to the Ukrainian president's office. Most of the casualties occurred in the Donbas, that eastern region made up of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, the office said. Six people were wounded in artillery fire in Kherson city, where a market area was hit.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

                    "snippet": "An attempted coup d’état in Sudan has so far left at least 56 dead and up to 600 wounded. Clashes erupted in the capital city Khartoum when the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the military headed by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan failed to agree on a transition to a civilian government. RSF launched a series of surprise attacks against the Sudanese military, and the resulting wave of instability threatens to unleash a civil war.\n\nThe RSF grew out of the Janjaweed Militia, which infamously committed war crimes in the Western Sudanese region of Darfur in the early 2000s. Saudi Arabia and the UAE historically have supported Janjaweed and employed the militia in Libyan and Yemeni conflicts. Led by Vice President Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti, the RSF seeks to build enough legitimacy to oppose the Sudanese military; however, prior to the coup, the RSF had mobilized 100,000 troops in support of the junta and to counter guerilla actions and peaceful protests.\n\nOngoing fighting has created a fog of war.\n\nIt appears the RSF first targeted the presidential palace and the residence of General al-Burhan. Clashes then spilled outside the capital. Both sides immediately claimed to control major strategic and urban centers, but it remains unclear who holds the upper hand.\n\nWhat is apparent is that General al-Burhan was not captured but has made no public statements on the escalating violence.\n\nAfter the fighting began, a wide range of actors called for a ceasefire. Local civil society, Egypt, South Sudan, the African Union, the European Union, the U.S., China, and Russia all expressed concern and offered to mediate. Of all the foreign actors involved in the tumult of Sudanese politics, Russia has the most direct engagement and incentive to support Hemeti.\n\nThe Wagner Group — a notorious private military company owned by close Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin, nicknamed “Putin’s Chef” — began providing high-level training and intelligence sharing to the RSF in 2017. Wagner has been accused of violating human rights in Ukraine, the Central African Republic, and Libya, while helping the RSF consolidate support by launching disinformation campaigns on social media.\n\nIn return for its services, Wagner was given control of several gold mines in Darfur, Blue Nile, and other Sudanese regions. The RSF has long controlled gold extraction in Sudan, giving Wagner an easy avenue to precious resources. The Russian-controlled mines are run via front companies that are connected to Prigozhin and various other members of Moscow’s elite. Meroe Gold, an extractor in Sudan, was sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2020 for ties to Wagner. The European Union later followed suit and sanctioned Meroe for the same reason.\n\nWagner’s presence in Sudan is strategically important for Moscow. When the West responded to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine with punishing sanctions, the Kremlin’s network of shady operators began tapping resources they control to fuel the war. The scheme to plunder Sudanese gold emerged as a way to bolster the Russian economy and build a war chest.\n\nAn investigative report conducted by CNN from February to July 2022 uncovered 16 known Russian gold-smuggling flights out of Sudan. These were allegedly overseen by a senior Wagner commander who had extensive experience operating in both Libya and Syria.\n\nMoscow has a track record of grabbing natural resources in Sudan and elsewhere in Africa. In 2018 the Sudanese government inked an oil refinery deal with Russia while the RSF facilitated the planned construction of a Russian Navy base in the Port of Sudan. The base will help secure oil supplies by serving as a protective bridgehead for Russian oil companies operating in the Red Sea.\n\nIt will not only help Russia secure a reliable source of income, but also provide the Russian military with a strategic location. Unlike the 20th century Cold War, which was fought between the U.S. and the USSR over ideology and geopolitics, its 21st century sequel is fought over geo-economics, and natural resources in particular: oil, gas, uranium, food, water, as well as gold and diamonds.\n\nThough renewed violence in Sudan may inconvenience Wagner, the group has already made enough inroads to ensure a steady supply of gold and oil in the event of civil war. Even as resources are stretched thin because of Prigozhin’s mercenary war in Ukraine, he will likely continue aiding the RSF, while causing enough chaos to strengthen its grip on Sudan. He needs Hemeti and his RSF to win.\n\nThe Russian playbook in Sudan closely mimics operations that are currently taking place in Libya, Syria, and the Central African Republic. All are politically unstable, resource-rich nations that supply Moscow with valuable commodities and help it dodge sanctions.\n\nRussia’s influence in Africa remains purely disruptive and predatory. The Kremlin will use Wagner as a cudgel to secure natural resources across Africa and push the U.S. out, just as they evicted France. To keep up, Washington should expand diplomatic engagement, intelligence operations, and sanctioning of all entities linked to Wagner in Africa.\n\nThe U.S. should launch, with its allies, a robust program of military training and arms sales to boost pro-Western governments in the areas where China, Russia, and ISIS are on the prowl.\n\nDr. Ariel Cohen is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and a member of the Council of Foreign Relations.

                    "snippet": "Where do you call home? I’ve travelled and lived in so many places that the question sometimes confused me. Being eastern Ukrainian doesn’t make it easy to look for your roots, either.\n\nTwo world wars, the Holodomor, Stalin’s red terror, the collapse of the USSR, decades of isolation from the outside world. But I know from tracing my family tree – as best I could – back to the 18th century that the place I was born into is my ancestral home. A small town called Dvorichna and the villages around it in Kharkiv Oblast, only 19 miles from the Russian border. Since the war, that home has become a frontline, my parents’ house has become a lair for the occupiers, my school has become a shooting range and my entire village has become a battlefield.\n\nLiving on the border, the two identities often mixed, on both sides, without much notice – although that has all changed now. Dvorichna was at the border with the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic since its foundation in 1918. But that border was nothing more than a line on a map. There was no physical border with neighbouring Russian villages and towns, and neither was there a linguistic or cultural one.\n\nMy father spent half of his childhood in the 1970s with his great-aunt in Urazovo and Logachevka, on the Russian side of the border, where people spoke the same dialect of Ukrainian, with its many Russian loan-words, as they did on the Ukrainian side. But back then, everyone was a Soviet citizen, or “Sovietskie liudi” (Soviet people), a new “nation” under the Russian communist regime, an attempt to unify culturally and linguistically diverse minorities of the USSR.\n\nAfter Ukraine proclaimed its independence in 1991, a real border went up and people found themselves in two different states. Except they still weren’t that different. We still watched the same films, same TV channels, we had the same celebrities, listened to the same music. I remember how as a child I asked my dad to turn the antenna towards Russia on Sundays in the mid-1990s to watch morning Disney cartoons in Russian.\n\nAs the years passed, the border became more tangible. Suddenly, they would check your bags and passport, and you couldn’t bring freshly a slaughtered pig to a market in Urazovo, or your late grandma’s icon back to Dvorichna, because there was an obstacle now, called customs. Local people naturally started to face an identity problem. So am I Russian, or am I Ukrainian? Back then, we were like that antenna: in Ukraine, but sometimes turning toward Russia. We didn’t see what was wrong with it.\n\nBut over the years, our true history, without Soviet censorship, opened up for us. Before school, I knew nothing about the Holodomor, I knew nothing about the crimes and repressions of Stalin’s regime, about the abolition of the Ukrainian language by the tsarist regime. My parents never told me because they didn’t know, my grandparents, born in the late 1940s, were taught a refined Soviet history and my great-grandparents were too scared to talk about those times. Learning that history led me and many others to realise our identity. I understood that I am Ukrainian, a culture distinct from that of the USSR or Russia. I almost let Russia erase memory and my true self.\n\nA monk lights a candle in Lviv on 26 November 2022 to commemorate the victims of the 1932-33 Holodomor in Ukraine, a famine created by Stalin in which millions died. Photograph: Yuriy Dyachyshyn/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSome people came to this realisation in school, some were affected by the orange revolution of 2004-5, some by the revolution of dignity in 2014, but the majority still remained uncertain. Revolutions were in Kyiv, far away and somewhat obscure, and Russia was here, close and clear.\n\nThe final test of identity for those of us living on the Ukrainian side of the border, was when the convoys of Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers crossed the 1991 border. For us it was an actual state border, no different from the one with Poland on the other side of the country. For the Russians it was that line on a map drawn by Lenin. It meant nothing to them, it was an error, just like Ukraine’s independence. That’s probably why it was so hard for them to understand why we aren’t happy about our “liberation” by Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe invasion has since shown us many instances of confused identities. I still ask myself why there were so many collaborators. My Ukrainian language teacher supported the orange revolution, and publicly shamed those who would switch to Russian when we visited Kharkiv. I was shocked when I later saw a YouTube video showing her at a meeting with the representatives of the occupying administration about beginning the school year under Russian curriculum. There was a smug look on her face, and she was taking gifts from them.\n\nAnother man who was the father of one of my teachers was pro-Russian, as some older people are, and he greeted their troops with flowers. But then Russian soldiers came to raid his house and he allegedly shot one of them, protecting his property. He was arrested, killed and buried, according to witnesses. I wonder what his thoughts were, when his liberators were trying to steal his carburettor, and what his thoughts were when they came to seize him, probably: “If only Putin knew what they were doing, he would have punished them”. As an old Russian saying goes: “The tsar is good, the courtiers are bad.”\n\nWhat made these people collaborate? I think some of them knew what they were doing. These people have chosen their identity – Russian. Many more didn’t collaborate in any way, and have either left or engaged in partisan resistance. They have also chosen their identity – Ukrainian.\n\nThen there are the majority who simply tried to get by, signing new employment contracts and reregistering their businesses under the new Russian administration, staying away from “politics”. They were simply trying to keep on living, like children who cover their eyes with their hands and think they are safe.\n\nBut the war has inevitably come to their doorstep. The middle school, where my dad used to work, is now a shooting range and a torture facility. They shoot people in our gymnasiums and torture them in our classrooms, they live in our homes and eat food from our cellars, they sleep in our beds and loot our properties. Why? Because Ukrainians dared to remember who we are, dared to find our identity. And those who were in identity limbo had to snap out of it and finally pick a side.",

The Western military hardware is believed to be essential to the Ukrainian attempts to push back the Russian forces in occupied territories towards the southern and eastern borders.

It is doing to certain places within Ukraine already. “And up until now, the Ukrainians, their own courage and their own intelligent use of the resources they have in waging the defence of their country has proven a significant factor in preventing further Russian advances. And the Russians are taking enormous losses.” The former Democrat nominee for President also told Rigby: “I want to keep the pressure up and make it even more on the Russians because as we now look at the available information, they could get more brutal in terms of the air defence. “Syria is a fairer example of what they're capable of doing. That's why the Ukrainians need more help to repel that.”\n\n‘I want to keep the pressure up and make it even more on the Russians’\n\nClinton also said that the US and NATO ‘should do much more to supply what Ukraine needs’\n\nIn another call to Biden, Clinton also said that the US and NATO “should do much more to supply what Ukraine needs”. “I was very pleased that Poland and others have been providing Soviet era MiG jets,” she said. “I think we ought to encourage NATO's nations, particularly those most directly affected by this terrible Russian aggression, to provide more.” She continued: “Not only planes to repel air space infractions, but also anti-aircraft missiles. Ukraine is getting enough help to be able to withstand the Russian invasion.\n\nTrending\n\nBill Clinton also regrets pressuring Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons back in 1993",

This was the command.'\n\nHe explained: 'We are killing each other, and I've no idea what for. I simply can't understand. I want to cry. But I won't be crying, I am so tired, I've been crying for the second day…\n\n'If I tell you the full truth about what's happening there, your hair will stand on end.'\n\nHe spoke of grotesque atrocities in Soledar and Bakhmut. The battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has seen the most bloody fighting of the war to date, with Wagner heavily involved in Russia's attempts to seize control.\n\nThe village of Soledar nearby was captured earlier this year, with Wagner's leader drawing the ire of the Kremlin by claiming his troops were solely responsible.\n\n'We were given the command to 'clean up' and destroy everyone,' Uldarov said.\n\n'We arrived with the last batch of Wagnerites, 150 people. And we were commanded to destroy on the way on our own and stand on the defensive by any means. We went and killed everyone.\n\n'There were women, men, grandfathers, pensioners, and children,' he said.\n\nThe other commander Alexei Savichev said that after a visit by journalists he and another comrade were ordered to slaughter civilians.\n\nHe knew of at least 70 executions of Russians by Russians, he said.\n\nThey were killed for refusing to fight or refusing to murder civilians, he claimed.\n\n'Civilians were leaving. And there was an order: everyone who is 15 [years old] and above - all at once to be shot without a word,' he claimed.\n\n'20 to 24 people were shot, of which 10 people were 15-year-olds and 17-year-old teenagers. How many were shot? Maybe 24 people, maybe 20.'\n\nHe said they were forced to 'follow orders' fearing they could be thrown back in jail if not. If they told journalists of the atrocities, a commander told them they would 'instantly be wasted', he said.\n\nThe two men who confessed are reported to be in Russia now which - if true - puts them in jeopardy of jail or worse.\n\nThe pair alleged that the head of Wagner - Yevgeny Prigozhin, nicknamed Putin's 'chef' (pictured earlier this month) - personally gave orders for executions and murders. Wagner mercenaries admit to killing women and children\n\nSmoke is seen in this drone footage of Bakhmut amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in this screen grab obtained from a handout video released on April 15\n\nIn November, Russian inmate-turned Wagner fighter Yevgeny Nuzhin - who changed sides in the Ukraine war - was executed with a sledgehammer in a harrowing video that circulated online. Prigozhin described Nuzhin as a traitor, with the close ally of Putin saying a 'dog receives a dog's death' in response to the clip.\n\nA second Wagner deserter - Dmitry Yakushchenko - was killed in the same way in February this year. His death was seen in a second, equally horrific video.\n\nThe head of the human rights group Gulagu, Vladimir Osechkin, said: 'Azamat and Alexei are in Russia, 100 per cent they are not under any influence of the SBU [Ukrainian intelligence] or CIA, or somebody else.'\n\nHe believes their 'chilling details of the execution of more than 20 Ukrainian children and teenagers [and] the explosion of a pit with more than 50 wounded prisoners' amounts to compelling evidence of war crimes.\n\nAs does the killing of war refuseniks and the 'cleansing' of residential buildings - 'killing everyone, including children'.\n\nSavichev said that in Bakhmut in January 'near the barracks, past the jam factory' - he had been ordered to throw grenades into a hole full of dozens of wounded and dead, and then burn the bodies with petrol and diesel.\n\nThe dead were Russian and Ukrainian.\n\n'I carried out the order and left,' he said.\n\n'Both ex-commanders of the Wagner PMC units said that Yevgeny Prigozhin personally gave criminal orders for the executions and murders, and also approved of terrorist methods and cruelty'.\n\nCommenting on a notorious video of the beheading of a military man, he said that it was 'nonsense' compared to what happened in the background of this.\n\nAsked how many shots he saw, Savichev said: 'I will tell the truth. I don't want to deceive you, or myself. About 70 people were shot.'\n\nAmong the executed were prisoners from a correctional colony in Russia's Voronezh region, he said.\n\nUldatov spoke of his motives for revealing the details.\n\nPictured: Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin is seen with fighters in a February video, in which he claimed that his mercenaries had captured to town of Soledar\n\nPictured: A soldier is seen through the window of the PMC Wagner Centre during the official opening of the office block in Saint Petersburg, Russia, November 4\n\n'I want to punish everyone. I want Russia and other states to know the truth. I don't want war, I don't want bloodshed,' he said.\n\n'Do you see me holding a cigarette in my hand? I carried out the order with this hand, killed the children. Understand? By order.\n\n'What we did when we went to Soledar and Bakhmut, that was the scene. We were given the command to clean up and to kill everyone.'\n\nHe was asked: 'Who gave such orders?'\n\nHe replied: 'Starting from the top. I had [commander] Korshun. [inaudible].\n\n'This is the first commander. Then Korshun. Above them is [Yevgeny] Prigozhin, who told us not to let anyone out, to kill everyone.'\n\nUldarov - who was in tears - said he took part in a massacre of civilians on 18 March in Bakhmut.\n\n'There were around 300, including around 40 kids,' he said. 'We were given the order to kill everyone. It was in the basement of a nine-story block of flats. The order came down from Prigozhin,' he said. 'No prisoners.'\n\n'We're people from the same religion….I don't understand what we were killing each other for.'\n\nEmpty coffins were sent back to Russia because there was nothing left of some casualties, he said.\n\nPrigozhin labelled Osechkin a 'maniac and degenerate'.\n\n'About shootings of children - of course nobody ever shoots civilians or children, nobody needs it at all,' he said in response to the confessions.\n\n'We went there to save them from the regime they were under.' He added on video: 'We have never touched [children] and do not touch. This is a gross lie.'\n\nOne of those allegedly killed by the ex-unit commanders was still alive, he said.\n\nPictured: Vladimir Osechkin, Russian human rights activist and a founder of Gulagu.net. Upon his human rights organisation releasing the confessions, he said he had no reason to believe that the pair were under the influence of Russian security services\n\nThe confessions from the two Wagner mercenaries is by no means the first time horrific Russian war crimes have been reported on.\n\nWithin the first month of the war, reports were already coming out of Ukraine of Russian soldiers executing civilians, with Kyiv accusing Moscow of genocide.\n\nNational headlines carried news about several civilians were killed in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, revealed after Russian forces withdrew from the area in March 2022.\n\nHundreds of corpses were found in the town, including some with their hands bound behind their backs and apparently executed.",

The group realized they were at the wrong home and were leaving.\n\nBlake Walsh and Kaylin Gillis. Courtesy Blake Walsh\n\n“We thought we were at the right address,” Walsh said. “We didn’t have any cell service to figure it out. As soon as we figured it out that we were at the wrong location, we started to leave, and that’s when everything happened.”\n\nWalsh said what occurred next was a blur.\n\n“My friend said, ‘They’re shooting — go!’ I tried to step on the gas as fast as I could, and that’s when the fatal shot came through,” Walsh said.\n\n“I want to believe it was instant. I’m hoping it was. I’m praying it was,” he said through tears.\n\nAuthorities said the suspect, Kevin Monahan, 65, fired twice after the group mistakenly turned into the driveway of his home. Monahan is alleged to have fired as the group was leaving, Washington County Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy told reporters Monday.\n\nMurphy said the group “clearly” posed no threat.\n\nOne of the bullets struck Gillis, who was pronounced dead several miles away after the group called 911, authorities said. Walsh said she was struck in the neck. They had to drive 5 miles because of the lack of cell service, he said.\n\n“It did not feel like that,\" Walsh said. \"It felt like 30 seconds. The adrenaline was rushing so bad.”\n\nMonahan was arraigned Sunday on charges of second-degree murder and pleaded not guilty, said his lawyer, Kurt Mausert.\n\nMausert said Monahan did not intend to hurt anyone when he fired.\n\n“When you have a victim and a tragedy, the thing everyone wants is a villain, but not every time there’s a victim and tragedy is there a villain,” he said. “A number of errors were made that were unintentional.”\n\nMonahan, who was being held Tuesday at the Warren County jail, is expected to appear in court Wednesday for a bail hearing, Mausert said.\n\nLeaders in New York condemned the gun violence, which came days after a teenager in Kansas City, Missouri, was gunned down when he mistakenly went to the wrong home to pick up his younger brothers.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., called Saturday’s shooting “horrifying” and said: “Our children shouldn’t be met with lethal violence for making simple, completely harmless mistakes. This reckless, senseless gun violence has stolen far too many children from their families, and it must be stopped.”\n\nWalsh said he met Gillis, an animal lover and aspiring marine biologist who graduated from Schuylerville High School in 2021, when he was a sophomore in high school.\n\nThe couple often spoke about being the “2%,” he said, citing an apparent statistic that indicated only 2% of high school sweethearts get married.\n\nThey had been a couple for more than four years.\n\n“I had high hopes, and I had plans,” Walsh said. “I didn’t want to be with anybody else, and I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.”\n\nHe said of Gillis: “I want the world to know how good of a person she really was and how much she impacted everybody who had the fortunate opportunity to be in her life.\"\n\nWalsh said he’ll miss “her smile,” “her eyes” and “how happy she was able to make me.”\n\nHe added, “My world was taken from me Saturday.”\n\nWalsh also said he plans to attend Monahan’s bond hearing and hopes he’s punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n\n“I need to see who took my girlfriend away from me. I need to look at him,” Walsh said.\n\nAntonio Planas reported from Schenectady and Tim Stelloh from Fort Bragg, Calif.",

                    "snippet": "An innocent mistake led to the unimaginable Saturday night in upstate New York: After a car pulled into the wrong driveway in Schuylerville, one of the passengers in the car was fatally shot as it turned around to leave. Kaylin Gillis, 20, was one of four people in the car; they were looking for a friend's house when they accidentally ended up in Kevin Monahan's driveway in the rural area, which is dark at night and easy to get lost in. The Washington County sheriff says no one exited the car or approached Monahan's home before the 65-year-old came out and fired two shots from his porch, the Times-Union reports. The car was not in the driveway long, the sheriff adds: \"There was no reason for Mr. Monahan to feel threatened.\"\n\nGillis was struck; the driver of the car she was in drove to a neighboring town so they could call 911, the New York Post reports. The sheriff says the area has little cellphone reception. Emergency responders attempted CPR, but Gillis did not survive. Meanwhile, someone else had called to report shots fired at Monahan's residence, and authorities had to speak to him through a 911 dispatcher and in person for more than an hour before he agreed to come out. He was taken to the county jail and charged with second-degree murder. A GoFundMe campaign is raising money for Gillis' family. (A teenager was recently shot in Kansas City when he went to the wrong door by mistake.)",

The reasons range from trying to turn their vehicle around to getting an address wrong.\n\nThe idea that someone could lose their life over such a common event is unimaginable. Yet this is exactly what happened to 20-year-old New Yorker Kaylin Gillis according to police.\n\nThe Washington County Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy said during Monday press conference Gillis and three other people were trying to find a friend’s house in Hebron, New York Saturday night at roughly 10 pm. While searching for their friend’s home, the car Gillis was in accidentally pulled into 65-year-old Kevin Monahan’s driveway.\n\nThe driver was turning the car around when Monahan busted out of the house and allegedly fired multiple shots, one which fatally struck Gillis.\n\nAccording to Fox News, the driver then reportedly drove to the neighboring town of Salem and the group called 911 as soon as they arrived.\n\nEmergency crews applied CPR to Gillis as soon as they arrived but could not revive her. She was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nMurphy said Monahan refused to cooperate when police attempted to question him about the incident and hid out in his home for over an hour. The cops eventually were able to take him into custody.\n\nMonahan was booked in the Washington County jail and has been charged with second degree murder.\n\n\n\nKevin Monahan\n\nMurphy said Gillis and her friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nThis is a very sad case of some young adults who were looking for a friend’s house and ended up at this man’s house who decided to come out with a firearm and discharge it.\n\nThe sheriff also claimed Gillis and her friends posed no threat at all to Monahan. He said they never interacted with the homeowner nor left the car.\n\nThere’s clearly no threat from anyone in the vehicle. There’s no reason for Mr. Monahan to feel threatened.\n\nMurphy then uttered something that some may construe as a potential conflict of interest: he said he personally knew the family and thought highly of them.\n\nI know for a fact that she comes from a good family, a very good family. And I know them personally, and she was a young girl that was taken way too young.\n\nMonohan’s attorney Kurt Mauser disputed with the sheriff’s version of events in an interview with CNN.\n\nThis was not a simple case of coming up a driveway and turning around. The description I was given by my client is there were multiple vehicles, including a motorcycle, revving engines, coming up the driveway at a high rate of speed.\n\nMauser also said that Monahan felt the Gillis and her friends “created an atmosphere and a fear that there was menace going on.”\n\nFox News reported that a GoFundMe has been posted to support Gillis’ funeral expenses. The fundraiser has raised more nearly $90,000 as of Tuesday afternoon.",

He said there was ”no reason for Mr. Monahan to feel threatened.”\n\nThe shooting happened days after 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was shot and wounded in Kansas City, Missouri, after going to the wrong house to pick up his younger brothers.",

                    "snippet": "THERE are striking similarities in the cases of two young Americans shot by homeowners last week but there is also one key difference, a legal expert exclusively told The U.S. Sun.\n\nRalph Yarl, 16, was trying to pick up his younger siblings in Kansas City, Missouri, on Thursday when he rang the wrong doorbell.\n\n4 Kaylin Gillis, 20, was in a car with her friends in rural Upstate New York when she was fatally shot after accidentally turning down the wrong driveway Credit: GoFundMe\n\n4 Ralph Yarl, 16, was trying to pick up his younger siblings in Kansas City, Missouri, on Thursday when he was shot after ringing the wrong doorbell Credit: Reuters\n\nThe teen was released from the hospital on Monday after police said he was shot in the head and arm by Andrew Lester, 84.\n\nKaylin Gillis, 20, was in a car with her friends in rural Upstate New York when they accidentally turned down the wrong driveway on Saturday night.\n\nAlthough no one got out of the car, homeowner Kevin Monahan, 65, went on his front port and shot at the vehicle, hitting Gillis who later died from her injuries, police said.\n\nMonahan was quickly charged with second-degree murder, but Lester was initially released after being in custody for just two hours.\n\nIt took prosecutors five days to charge Lester with first-degree assault and armed criminal action. He has since been arrested.\n\nThis disparity is likely because the case against Monahan is much more straightforward, said Henry Chambers, a law professor at the University of Richmond.\n\n\"There can be a distinction between someone walking up to your door and entering the door versus you coming out of your house in order to shoot somebody,\" he said.\n\nChambers said that it will be hard for Monahan to prove that Gillis and her friends could be considered a potential threat, something that would be required for a stand-your-ground defense.\n\n\"It's kind of hard to argue that I needed to leave my house because I was afraid that people were actually actively breaking into my house when they never got out of the car,\" Chambers said.\n\nSince Yarl came up to Lester's front door, Chambers said it'll be easier for the suspect to argue that he believed the teen was trying to break in.\n\nThe different police approaches may have also been informed by variations in state law.\n\nChambers noted that gun laws in New York are generally stricter than in Missouri.\n\n\"People's visions of the use of weapons will be different in different places,\" he said.\n\nChambers also spoke about the move to release Lester shortly after the shooting.\n\nThe suspect's advanced age means he's unlikely to flee, the professor said.\n\nThis would have made it much easier for police to justify sending him home as they continued their investigation.\n\nBut like Monahan, Lester will likely face an uphill battle in court, according to Chambers.\n\n\"My guess is that the suspect will continue to say: 'I thought he was gonna break into my house,'\" the professor said.\n\n\"He's got more latitude to use force if he says [that].\"\n\nIt will be hard to prove that was a reasonable conclusion given the details about the shooting that have been made public, according to Chambers.\n\n\"What we've heard so far is that the young fellow rang the doorbell, stood back, and the next thing he knows, he gets shot twice,\" Chambers said.\n\n\"There's just no justification for [the shooting] if that's the way that this worked out.\"\n\nLester was released on bail on Tuesday night.\n\n4 Kevin Monahan, 65, was quickly arrested and charged with second-degree murder in New York for Kaylin Gillis's death Credit: Washington County New York",

One of those bullets hit Gillis.\n\nSomeone inside the vehicle called 911 for help when the group drove to nearby Salem. After first responders arrived at the scene, they performed CPR on the injured woman in an effort to revive her, but she was eventually pronounced dead.\n\n“When deputies arrived at Monahan’s property to investigate, he would not cooperate and refused to exit his house.

Murphy.\n\nThey quickly realized their mistake and were turning the car around when Monahan stepped onto his porch and fired two shots, one of which struck Gillis.\n\nShort on cellphone signal, her friends drove 5 miles to the town of Salem to call 911. Emergency responders performed CPR on Gillis but she was pronounced dead on the scene.\n\nMonahan has been charged with murder in the second degree and remains in custody at Warren County Jail, the sheriff said. It's unclear whether he's retained an attorney.\n\nHe was initially uncooperative with investigators, refusing for several hours to exit his residence or answer questions, the sheriff said.\n\nMurphy summed the case as a \"very sad\" incident involving an \"innocent young woman.\"\n\n\"There was clearly no threat from anyone in the vehicle. There was no reason for Monahan to feel threatened,\" he said.\n\nHe added that he wasn't aware of any interaction between the passengers and Monahan. No one exited the vehicle, which was only in the driveway \"for a very short time,\" he said.\n\nIt's also not uncommon for drivers to turn onto the wrong property in the area. Hebron, a hilly farming region tucked in the shadow of the Adirondack Mountains, registered a population of 1,786 in the 2020 census.\n\n\"It's a very rural area. There's dirt roads. There's not a lot of cell service or any type of internet,\" the sheriff said.\n\nHowever, Monahan's lawyer, Kurt Mausert, said the sheriff's account of what happened in the driveway and his characterization of his client as uncooperative are incorrect. His client had been afraid when he pulled the trigger, Mausert told WAMC/Northeast Public Radio.\n\n\"There were errors, there were misunderstandings that culminated in a tragedy. But the fact that we have a victim in a tragedy does not mean there's a villain. Villain, to me, requires bad intent and my client, I don't believe – the facts will show – that he had bad intent,\" he said.\n\nKaylin Gillis had lived in a nearby town\n\nGillis was from Schuylerville, N.Y., roughly 18 miles away from where she died. She had planned to attend college in Florida, with hopes of becoming a marine biologist, according to a statement from Gillis' family shared with WAMC.\n\nThe mayor of Schuylerville, Dan Carpenter, told WAMC the incident made him think of his teen daughter, a newly minted driver.\n\n\"I mean, you just make a wrong turn, you turn around someone's driveway, and you get shot. I mean, who could imagine that?\" he said.\n\nThe shooting came just a few days after a 16-year-old was shot through a glass door by an 84-year-old man in Kansas City. The teenager, Ralph Yarl, had been trying to pick up his brothers when he mistakenly approached the wrong house.",

                    "snippet": "A neighbor, Adam Matthews, said he wasn't surprised Monahan was accused of the horrific crime\n\nThe upstate New York man accused of killing a 20-year-old woman, who was a passenger in the car that accidentally drove up his driveway has been described by a neighbor as a 'narcissist with a short fuse,' who would often 'rage about trespassers.'\n\nAdam Matthews told The New York Post that he was not surprised when he learned that his construction boss neighbor Kevin Monahan, 65, was accused in the shooting death of Kaylin Gillis on his remote property in the town of Hebron.\n\nGillis was traveling with three friends on Saturday night around 10pm looking for a friend's address when the driver of the vehicle mistakenly pulled into Monahan's driveway.\n\nMonahan reportedly stepped out onto his porch, reportedly firing two shots, one of which hit Gillis, who was a passenger in the vehicle, according to Washington County Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy.\n\nMatthews said one of Monahan's biggest pet peeves was people trespassing on his property.\n\nKevin Monahan, 65, was reportedly charged with murder in the second degree and remains in custody at Warren County Jail, officials said\n\nKaylin Gillis, 20, was enjoying a night out with friends before she was shot dead on Sunday night in the senseless killing. She was remembered by distraught family and friends as a gentle soul who loved animals\n\nThe rural farming area located near the Adirondack mountains has a population of 1,786, according to the 2020 US Census Bureau, and is comprised of dirt roads with minimal cell and internet service.\n\nThe neighbor said when he first heard the news his 'knee-jerk reaction' was that 'somebody probably drove up Kevin's driveway to settle a beef.'\n\n'If someone said that out of this whole road, something happened, who would be the first person who popped into my mind? Kevin,' he claimed.\n\nMatthews said it was 'shocking,' and felt sorry for the young victim.\n\n'There was never any doubt he had a short fuse. I think he was a bit of a narcissist,' Matthews claimed. 'He could do no wrong, but everybody else didn't know jack s—t.'\n\nSheriff Jeffrey J. Murphy told NPR it is not uncommon for drivers to turn into the wrong property due to the remote location with spotty cell service.\n\n'It's a very rural area. There's dirt roads,' Murphy said. 'There's not a lot of cell service or any type of internet.'\n\nAfter the shooting, the victim's frantic friends had to drive to the neighboring town of Salem to call for help.\n\nMonahan's property is situated on Patterson Hill Road in the town of Hebron located near the Adirondack mountains\n\nGillis, who is from Schuylerville, New York was roughly 18 miles from home when the tragedy occurred.\n\nMatthews said that Monahan would always gripe about people driving up his driveway thinking it was a road.\n\n'He was very adamant people didn't come up, and for a long time he kept the bottom of his driveway gated because so many people did mistake it for a roadway because it's so wide at the bottom,' he said.\n\nThe property line even stumped police when they first responded to the shooting, he said.\n\nMonahan was charged with murder in the second degree and remains in custody at Warren County Jail, officials said.\n\nAfter the shooting, Monahan was not cooperating with authorities and the New York State Police Special Operation Response Team was called in to assist, before he was taken into custody, according to a sheriff's department news release.\n\nThe sheriff described the tragic killing as 'very sad.'\n\n'There was clearly no threat from anyone in the vehicle,' he said. 'There was no reason for Monahan to feel threatened.'",

There was no reason for Mr. Monahan to feel threatened,\" Murphy said. \"This is a very sad case of some young adults that were looking for a friend’s house and ended up at this man’s house who decided to come out with a firearm and discharge it.\"\n\nAfter the shooting, police attempted to arrest Monahan, but he was \"uncooperative and refused to exit his residence to speak with police,\" police said in a press release. He was taken into custody \"several hours\" later.\n\nPolice charged Monahan with second-degree murder.\n\nKaylin Gillis remembered as ‘sweet,’ ‘thoughtful’ www.youtube.com\n\nThe shocking incident happened just days after 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was shot when he went to the wrong home while looking for relatives.\n\nProsecutors have charged 85-year-old Andrew D. Lester with one felony count of assault in the first degree and one felony count of armed criminal action for shooting Yarl. Clay County Prosecutor Zachary Thompson believes there was a \"racial component\" to the shooting; Lester is white and Yarl was black.\n\nLike Blaze News?

                    "snippet": "A 20-year-old woman was fatally shot by a homeowner after she and her friends mistakenly pulled into the wrong driveway while trying to look for their friend's house, police said.\n\nKaylin Gillis and her friends were driving in a rural area of upstate New York on Saturday night, searching for their friend's address with limited cell service, Washington County Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy said at a news conference on Monday. They drove up to the wrong residence and realized their mistake, and just as they were leaving, a man came out of the house and fired at least two shots, according to Murphy. One of the bullets struck Gillis, killing her.\n\nThe suspect, 65-year-old Kevin D. Monahan, was arrested later that night and charged with second-degree murder.\n\nMonahan's lawyer, Kurt Mausert, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Mausert told the Washington Post that Monahan had no prior penal law convictions.\n\n\"My preliminary view of this case is that it was a series of errors which resulted in a tragedy,\" Mausert told the Post. \"It is too soon to say more than that.\"\n\nMonahan lived in Hebron, approximately 56 miles from Albany. After Gillis was shot, her friends drove to a nearby town where there was cell service and called 911. Emergency responders were unable to save Gillis.\n\n\"There was no reason for Mr. Monahan to feel threatened, especially as it appears the vehicle was leaving,\" the sheriff said.\n\nMonahan was uncooperative when police arrived at his house and did not come out, Murphy said. Officers spent more than an hour trying to talk to him, and he was taken into custody hours later, he added.\n\nMonahan is currently being held at the Warren County Jail.\n\n\"An innocent young girl out with friends, looking for another friend's house,\" Murphy said. \"I know for a fact that she comes from a good family — a very good family. And I know that personally. She's a young girl that was taken way too young.\"\n\nGillis had just turned 20, according to a GoFundMe for her funeral expenses.\n\n\"On behalf of the Gillis family, we would like to thank everyone who has offered their love and prayers as they embark on this incredibly difficult journey of grief and healing,\" the fundraiser said.\n\nGillis's fatal shooting comes just days after a Black 16-year-old boy in Kansas City, Missouri, was similarly shot by a homeowner when he rang the doorbell of the wrong home. An 84-year-old man has been charged with two felonies over the shooting, and the teen, Ralph Yarl, is recovering, his family said.",

Gun ownership, meanwhile, has risen significantly in recent years, skyrocketing during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe latest victim in New York, who police identified as Kaylin Gillis, was riding in a car with friends in search of another friend's house when they pulled into Monahan's driveway around 10 pm. Murphy said they were only in the driveway a short time before they realized the mistake and turned to leave.\n\nIt was then, Murphy said, that Monohan walked onto his porch and shot twice, hitting the car once. The group then drove to a nearby house where there was better cellphone service and called the police.\n\n\"It's a very rural area. There's dirt roads. There's not a lot of cellular service or any type of internet, so they were basically looking for their friend's house and mistaken,\" Murphy said.\n\nMurphy said that Monahan was \"not cooperative\" when police responded to his home after the shooting and refused to come outside to talk to police.\n\n\"After approximately more than an hour of talking back and forth through 911 and trying to talk to him in person on the scene, he was taken into custody,\" Murphy said at the news conference.",

                    "snippet": "The upstate New York construction boss accused of gunning down a 20-year-old woman has been described by a neighbor as a “narcissist” with a “short fuse” who would constantly rage about people mistaking his driveway for a road.\n\nKevin Monahan, 65, was charged with second-degree murder after he allegedly fatally shot Kaylin Gillis when the car she was in accidentally drove up his Hebron driveway Saturday night while looking for a friend’s house.\n\n“It’s shocking, but I’m not surprised,” Monahan’s next-door neighbor, Adam Matthews, told The Post on Tuesday.\n\n“He had a short fuse. There was never any doubt he had a short fuse. I think he was a bit of a narcissist.\n\n“He could do no wrong, but everybody else didn’t know jack s—t.”\n\nMonahan’s biggest pet peeve was trespassers, according to the neighbor.\n\n“It was always, ‘People just drive up my driveway and they think it’s a road.’ He was very adamant people didn’t come up, and for a long time he kept the bottom of his driveway gated because so many people did mistake it for a roadway because it’s so wide at the bottom,” Matthews said.\n\nEven police got confused about where to go when they first responded to the shooting, the neighbor added.\n\n“If someone said that out of this whole road, something happened, who would be the first person who popped into my mind? Kevin. My knee-jerk reaction when I first learned of it, I thought somebody probably drove up Kevin’s driveway to settle a beef,” the neighbor said.\n\nKevin Monahan, 65, has been charged with second-degree murder after he allegedly fatally shot Kaylin Gillis in upstate New York on Saturday night. Washington County Sheriff's Office\n\nA second neighbor, who didn’t want to be named, described Monahan as an “irritable character, kind of ornery.”\n\n“From what he told me, it seemed he presumed the worst in people,” the neighbor told The Post. “He was more cynical, just an irritable personality, someone who was easy to get into an argument with.”\n\nGillis and three of her pals were looking for a friend’s house when they mistakenly made a wrong turn into Monahan’s driveway at about 10 p.m. on Saturday, Washington County Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy said.\n\nThey were trying to turn the car around when Monahan allegedly emerged from his home and fired two shots from his porch — one of which struck the 20-year-old woman.\n\nKaylin Gillis, 20, was killed Saturday night after she was struck by gunfire. Kaylin Gillis/Facebook\n\nThe group fled the property and called 911 from the neighboring town of Salem, the sheriff said, adding the area where the shooting took place had limited cell service.\n\nGillis was pronounced dead when first responders reached the car.\n\nThe house the friends had been looking for was just half a mile further up the road from Monahan’s driveway.\n\nThe owner of that home, who also didn’t want to be identified, said his son had been having a small gathering that night and Gillis had been invited through a mutual friend.\n\n“This is unbelievable,” he said. “And to have a f–king scumbag that lives down the road. Something like this never should have happened. This is absolutely ridiculous.”\n\nThe sheriff previously said Monahan had no reason to open fire on the vehicle — noting that no one had exited the car in the driveway before the shots rang out.\n\nMonahan’s next-door neighbor, Adam Matthews, said Monahan was always griping about people mistaking his driveway for a road. Angus Mordant for NY Post\n\n“There’s clearly no threat from anyone in the vehicle,” Murphy said at a Monday news conference, adding that it was “easy to get lost” in the rural area.\n\n“There’s no reason for Mr. Monahan to feel threatened.”\n\nWhen deputies arrived at Monahan’s home after the shooting, the sheriff said the suspect was allegedly uncooperative and refused to leave his home.\n\nHe was taken into custody several hours later after the New York State Police Special Operation Response Team was called in to assist, the sheriff said.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Tuesday, the sheriff revealed Monahan had already obtained a lawyer by the time he emerged from his home to turn himself over.\n\n“There was never any doubt he had a short fuse. I think he was a bit of a narcissist,” Matthews added. Angus Mordant for NY Post\n\n“[He], quite frankly, has not shown any remorse in this case,” Murphy said, adding that the suspect has yet to make a statement about the shooting.\n\nThe suspect’s attorney, Kurt Mauser, rejected any notion of a standoff — insisting his client didn’t even know the gunfire had struck anyone.\n\n“This was not a standoff,” the attorney said. “This was my client and I not knowing what was going on in terms of the charges that were pending.”\n\nThe attorney also told CNN that Monahan said three vehicles, including a motorcycle, had actually pulled into his driveway and they were “revving engines [and] coming up the driveway at a high rate of speed” prior to him opening fire.\n\nMonahan claimed to his lawyer that it “created an atmosphere and a fear that there was menace going on.”\n\nMauser said he was informed of Gillis’ death and the charge his client was facing after he made contact with authorities.

                    "snippet": "CNN —\n\nA 20-year-old woman was shot and killed Saturday after she and three others accidentally turned into the wrong driveway while looking for a friend’s house in rural upstate New York, authorities said.\n\nThe woman, identified as Kaylin Gillis, was a passenger in a vehicle when a man, 65-year-old Kevin Monahan, fired two shots from his front porch, Washington County Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy said in a news conference Monday. One of the shots hit the vehicle and struck Gillis, the sheriff said.\n\n“It’s a very rural area with dirt roads. It’s easy to get lost. They drove up this driveway for a very short time, realized their mistake and were leaving, when Mr. Monahan came out and fired two shots,” the sheriff said, adding that the area has poor cell phone service.\n\nMonahan has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with her death, Murphy said. He was arraigned Sunday on the murder charge, his attorney told CNN. A bail hearing is pending for Tuesday or Wednesday, the district attorney and defense attorney both said.\n\nThe shooting happened just days after a Black teenager in Kansas City was shot twice by a White homeowner after going to the wrong address to pick up his siblings.\n\nIn that case, Andrew Lester, 84, opened fire on 16-year-old Ralph Yarl as the teen stood at Lester’s front door before any words had been exchanged, according to a probable cause document obtained by CNN. Lester, who told police he thought the teen was trying to break in, faces two felony charges in a case that touches on so-called “stand your ground” laws, the proliferation of firearms and racial bias.\n\nIn the New York shooting, both Monahan and Gillis are White. No one is believed to have exited the car, and there was no interaction between Monahan and anyone in the vehicle before shots were fired, Murphy said.\n\n“There was clearly no threat from anyone in the vehicle. There was no reason for Mr. Monahan to feel threatened,” Murphy said.\n\nAfter the shots were fired, Gillis and the rest of the group drove away from the house in the town of Hebron looking for cell phone service and then called 911.\n\nThey were found around 5 miles away from the home in the nearby town of Salem. First responders began administering CPR but Gillis was pronounced dead at the scene, Murphy said.\n\n“This is a very sad case of some young adults that were looking for a friend’s house and ended up at this man’s house who decided to come out with a firearm and discharge it,” the sheriff said.\n\nShooting suspect’s attorney offers different version of shooting\n\nKevin Monahan, 65, has been charged with second-degree murder. Washington County Sheriff's Office\n\nMonahan’s attorney, Kurt Mauser, disagreed with the sheriff’s description of events.\n\n“This was not a simple case of coming up a driveway and turning around,” he told CNN. “The description I was given by my client is there were multiple vehicles, including a motorcycle, revving engines, coming up the driveway at a high rate of speed.”\n\nMauser said Monahan felt that “created an atmosphere and a fear that there was menace going on.”\n\nThe sheriff confirmed there were several vehicles traveling together – a car with two passengers; a car with four passengers, including Gillis and her boyfriend; and a motorcycle – driving up and down the street looking for an address.\n\nHe said witness accounts from inside the cars and forensics prove the shots were fired as the group exited the driveway. The car in which Gillis was a passenger was the last vehicle to turn around and leave, he said.\n\n“I don’t know how they could menace anyone with those type of actions, but they were clearly leaving the residence when the shots were fired,” Murphy told CNN. He also said no 911 calls regarding loud noises coming from vehicles were reported by Monahan or neighbors.\n\nAfter the shooting, police officers responded to Monahan’s home and found him to be uncooperative, Murphy said, adding he “refused to exit his residence to speak with police.”\n\nHe was taken into custody hours later with help from the New York State Police Special Operations Response Team, according to a press release from the Washington County Sheriff’s office.\n\nSpeaking to CNN on Tuesday, Murphy said Monahan had not made any statement about the shooting and obtained a lawyer before he came out of the house.\n\n“(He), quite frankly, has not shown any remorse in this case,” he said.\n\nHowever, Mauser pushed back against the notion that there was a standoff with police when he was asked to surrender.\n\nMonahan had no idea that the bullets he fired had struck someone, and he called Mauser to report there were four sheriff’s deputies on his road and had “no idea” what they wanted, the attorney told CNN’s Brynn Gingras.\n\nMauser said he got in touch with law enforcement and was informed of the fatality and charge, at which point he arranged for his client to lawfully turn himself over to police.\n\n“This was not a standoff,” the attorney said. “This was my client and I not knowing what was going on in terms of the charges that were pending.”\n\nMonahan’s driveway is 1/8th of a mile long and has no trespassing and private driveway signs, the attorney said.\n\nKaylin Gillis was soon to start college\n\nKaylin Gillis graduated from Schuylerville High School in 2021 and held the position of \"flyer\" on the school's cheerleading team. Courtesy Schuylerville Varsity Cheerleading\n\nGillis’ family issued a statement praising her as a “kind, beautiful soul and a ray of light to anyone who was lucky enough to know her.”\n\n“She was a big sister, much loved daughter, devoted friend and partner to her loving boyfriend. She was just beginning to find her way in the world with kindness, humor, and love,” the family said. “Kaylin was a talented artist, an honor student, a Disney fanatic and loved animals. She was looking forward to starting college in Florida to pursue her dream of becoming a marine biologist.\n\n“She was taken from us far too soon, and we are devastated. Our family will never be the same but we will be guided by Kaylin’s positivity, optimism, and joy as we learn to live with her loss.”\n\nThe family also thanked those who have expressed support and asked for privacy. “Your well wishes and prayers are deeply appreciated, have been heard and will carry us through this difficult journey,” the family said.\n\nGillis was \"always smiling and laughing,\" her former cheerleading coach said. CNN blurred a portion of this image to protect individuals' identities. Courtesy Schuylerville Varsity Cheerleading\n\nGillis graduated from Schuylerville High School in 2021 and held the position of “flyer” on the school’s cheerleading team, her former cheer coach Charlene Deming said.\n\n“She was always smiling and laughing, and trying to make others laugh,” Deming told CNN.\n\nMurphy, the sheriff, said he was a friend of the victim’s family and lamented the killing. “A case like this is absolutely senseless,” he said.\n\nMore than $97,000 has been raised for Gillis’ family in a GoFundMe raising money for the “Gillis family for use toward Kaylin’s funeral expenses and any immediate financial needs,” according to the page.\n\nChuchay Stark, a woman who lives in the county where this happened and took high school senior portraits of Gillis, said the community is going through a spectrum of emotions “from disgust to being heartbroken.” She recalled Gillis as one of the few kids who “knew exactly what she wanted” and was sweet to work with.",

Angus Mordant for NY Post\n\nThe friends fled the property and called 911 from the neighboring town of Salem, but Gillis was already dead by the time help arrived.\n\nThe sheriff previously said Monahan had no reason to open fire on the vehicle – noting no one had exited the car in the driveway before the shots rang out.\n\n“There’s clearly no threat from anyone in the vehicle,” Murphy said, adding that it was “easy to get lost” in the rural area. “There’s no reason for Mr. Monahan to feel threatened.”",

I’m heartbroken,” Angelique Gillis wrote. “I can’t put into words how to even express how thankful for everyone’s love and support. My beautiful baby didn’t deserve this. She had so much to live for and so many dreams. She was the light of our lives.”\n\nThose dreams included becoming either a veterinarian or marine biologist after she graduated from Schuylerville Central School in 2021, according to her obituary.\n\nShe loved being around animals, especially goats and dolphins.\n\nHer obituary also called her the glue of her family and that she “lit up any room she was in.”\n\n“Kaylin was a kind, beautiful soul and a ray of light to anyone who was lucky enough to know her. She was a big sister, much loved daughter, devoted friend, and partner to her loving boyfriend,” Andrew Gillis posted on Facebook.\n\nKaylin Gillis was shot and killed Saturday night after driving up the wrong driveway.\n\n“She was just beginning to find her way in the world with kindness, humor, and love. Kaylin was a talented artist, an honor student, a Disney fanatic, and loved animals. She was looking forward to starting college in Florida to pursue her dream of becoming a marine biologist.\n\n“She was taken from us far too soon, and we are devastated. Our family will never be the same but we will be guided by Kaylin’s positivity, optimism, and joy as we learn to live with her loss.”\n\nHe added he was grateful for the support he and his family have received that “will carry us through this difficult journey.”\n\nBoth of her parents remembered their loving daughter as a ‘beautiful soul” who had “so much to live for and so many dreams.” Kaylin Gillis/Facebook\n\nThe shocking shooting happened around 10 p.m. Saturday in the Town of Hebron while Gillis and her pals were searching for a friend’s home in the rural area filled with dirt roads.\n\nAfter Gillis was hit with one of the two shots allegedly fired by Monahan, the driver of the car quickly fled from the home, Washington County Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy said during a Monday press conference. The group of friends connected with 911 after driving miles from the home into a neighboring town in an area with poor cellphone reception.\n\nGillis was pronounced dead after first responders were not able to save her.\n\nMurphy said the group of friends posed no threat to Monahan and didn’t even exit the car when they inadvertently pulled into his driveway. The homeowner has been charged with murder.\n\nKevin Monahan was charged with murder. Washington County Sheriff's Office\n\nThe suspect’s lawyer, Kurt Mauser, claimed to CNN Tuesday his client didn’t even know the bullets he fired had struck anyone.\n\nMauser also told CNN he had been told by Monahan there were multiple vehicles that pulled into his driveway, including a motorcycle, and that they were “revving engines [and] coming up the driveway at a high rate of speed.”\n\nHe argued this “created an atmosphere and a fear that there was menace going on,” for Monahan.\n\nNeighbors told The Post that Monahan was known for having a short fuse and hated people driving up to his property by accident.\n\nGillis’ life will be remembered Friday when a celebration of life and a community gathering will take place.\n\nAlong with her two grieving parents, Gillis leaves behind two sisters, her longtime boyfriend, three grandparents and many other relatives.",

(Susan Pfannmuller/The Kansas City Star via AP)\n\nProtestors march Sunday, April 16, 2023, in Kansas City, Mo., to bring attention to the shooting of Ralph Yarl, 16, who was shot when he went to the wrong Kansas City house to pick up his brothers. (Susan Pfannmuller/The Kansas City Star via AP)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — An 84-year-old white man in Kansas City, Missouri, was charged Monday with first-degree assault for shooting a Black teen who mistakenly went to the man’s home to pick up his younger brothers.\n\nProsecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson said at a news conference that there was a “racial component” Thursday night when Andrew Lester twice shot 16-year-old Ralph Yarl, who is recovering at home after being released from the hospital. But nothing in the charging documents says the shooting was racially motivated, Thompson clarified.\n\n“We understand how frustrating this has been but I can assure you the criminal justice system is working and will continue to work,” Thompson said.\n\nThe shooting outraged many in Kansas City and across the country. Civic and political leaders — including President Joe Biden — demanded justice. Some, including lawyers for Yarl, pressed the racial dimension of the case.\n\nYarl, an honor student and all-state band member, was supposed to pick up his two younger brothers when he approached the wrong house at roughly 10 p.m. Lester came to the door and shot Yarl in the forehead — then shot him again, in the right forearm.\n\nNo words were exchanged before the shooting, the probable cause statement said. But afterward, as Yarl got up to run, he heard Lester yell, “Don’t come around here,” the statement said.\n\nYarl ran to “multiple” homes asking for help before finding someone who would call the police, the statement said.\n\nRev. Vernon Howard, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Kansas City, called the shooting a “heinous and hate-filled crime.” Vice President Kamala Harris wrote on Twitter that “No child should ever live in fear of being shot for ringing the wrong doorbell.” The Missouri Senate held a moment of silence for Yarl on Monday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe civil rights attorneys for Yarl’s family, Ben Crump and Lee Merritt, said in a statement that Biden called Yarl’s family and offered “prayers for Ralph’s health and for justice.”\n\n“Gun violence against unarmed Black individuals must stop,” the lawyers’ statement read. “Our children should feel safe, not as though they are being hunted.”\n\nYarl’s supporters plan to hold a rally Tuesday evening in Kansas City.\n\nThe assault charge carries a penalty of up to life in prison. Lester also was charged with armed criminal action, which has a penalty range of three to 15 years in prison. Lester was not charged with a hate crime. Thompson said Missouri’s statute is considered a lesser felony than first-degree assault, and carries a less severe penalty.\n\nMissouri is among roughly 30 states with “Stand Your Ground” laws, which allow for the use of deadly force in self-defense, but the prosecutor determined the shooting was not in self defense.\n\nAn arrest warrant was issued but Lester was not yet in custody, Thompson said.\n\nLester told police that he lives alone and had just gone to bed when he heard his doorbell, according to the probable cause statement. He said he picked up his gun and went to the door, where he saw a Black male pulling on the exterior storm door handle and thought someone was breaking in.\n\nA number for Lester was not in service on Monday evening and it was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney to speak on his behalf.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe shooting happened in a middle class neighborhood in north Kansas City. Yarl didn’t have a phone with him and went to the wrong block, his aunt, Faith Spoonmore, wrote on a GoFundMe page set up to help pay medical bills. By Monday afternoon, $1.4 million had been raised.\n\nPolice Chief Stacey Graves said that Yarl’s parents asked him to pick up his brothers at a home on 115th Terrace, but he mistakenly went to 115th Street, the Kansas City Star reported.\n\nYarl is a bass clarinetist who earned Missouri All-State Band honorable mention and who plays several instruments in the Metropolitan Youth Orchestra of Kansas City, Spoonmore wrote. A statement from the North Kansas City School District described Yarl as “an excellent student and talented musician.”\n\nSpoonmore said Yarl is “doing well physically” but has a lot of trauma to overcome emotionally.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the home where the shooting happened had been vandalized. Black spray-paint on the side of the house showed a heart with “16” in the middle. Eggs splattered the front windows and the door.\n\nA message seeking comment from Republican Gov. Mike Parson, a staunch gun rights supporter, wasn’t immediately returned.\n\nCrump, who has represented families in several high-profile cases of Black people being shot, including those of Trayvon Martin , Michael Brown, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, questioned why the shooter wasn’t arrested and charged immediately.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“We all believe that if the roles were reversed and this was a Black citizen who shot a 16-year-old for merely ringing his doorbell, they would have arrested him, and he wouldn’t have slept in his bed that night,” Crump said.\n\nTwo days after Yarl was shot, a 20-year-old woman was killed by a homeowner in Upstate New York Saturday after the car she was in drove to the wrong address. Washington County Sheriff Jeffrey Murphy said Kaylin Gillis was in a car with three others looking for a friend’s house.\n\nAs the car was turning around, Kevin Monahan came out and fired two shots, one of which struck Gillis. Monahan was charged with second-degree murder.\n\n___\n\nSalter reported from O’Fallon, Missouri. Nick Ingram in Kansas City and Summer Ballentine in Columbia, Missouri, contributed to this report.",

The law permits homeowners to protect themselves, or a third party (with exceptions) with deadly force should a person feel it is necessary. According to Missouri Revised Statutes 563.031 residents must be faced with a threat before shooting trespassers on the property. It states: '[Protective] force is used against a person who unlawfully enters, remains after unlawfully entering, or attempts to unlawfully enter a dwelling, residence, or vehicle lawfully occupied by such person.' 'Stand-your-ground' laws roughly define how an individual can defend themselves when faced with an imminent threat anywhere else; imminent being a keyword here because even threatening words towards a defending person can lead to a justified homicide.

The man in his 80s went home and slept in his bed that night. But I'm not sure what the prosecutor was referring to exactly.'\n\nRalph's mother told CBS News that her son was waiting for a hug from his twin brothers but instead 'got a couple of bullets'.\n\nA talented bass clarinet player, Ralph also leads a section of his school's marching band and plays multiple instruments in the Northland Symphony Youth Orchestra\n\nThe house in Kansas City, Missouri had a 'no solicitors' sign on top of the doorbell which Ralph mistakenly rang\n\nYarl is said to be recovering, but his mother said he mostly 'just sits there and stares and the buckets of tears just rolls down his eyes'.\n\nShe said that the bullet in his arm was not removed for 12 hours, and that the residual effect of the injury is going to stay with him for 'quite a while'.\n\nPresident Joe Biden rang the Yarl family on Monday, and invited them to the White House when Ralph is well enough.\n\nYarl's mother revealed that they spoke about music, with the president saying that if his family had to rely on his musical skills then they would 'die hungry' - and the teen quipping that Biden 'had jokes'.\n\nCrump added that it was a tragedy it had taken the prosecutor so long to charge Lester, saying: 'I think it is appropriate, you can't send a message to society that it's okay to shoot black people in the head just for ringing your doorbell.\n\n'Gun violence against unarmed black individuals must stop. Our children should feel safe, not as though they are being hunted.\n\n'While this is certainly a step in the right direction, we will continue to fight for Ralph while he works towards a full recovery.'\n\nThompson, asked why Lester was not charged with attempted murder, said they had decided to charge him with an 'A felony' because it was the most serious crime.\n\nLester was taken in for questioning immediately after the shooting, but was released two hours after he was arrested – without any charges.\n\nPolice took a statement from Ralph in hospital last Friday before he was released on Monday, to continue to recover at home with his mother - who is a nurse.\n\nPresident Joe Biden rang the Yarl family on Monday, and invited them to the White House when Ralph is well enough\n\nThe property also had a sign claiming it was 'protected by surveillance cameras'\n\nCleo Nagbe, with attorney Lee Merritt, said that her son Ralph Yarl is able to communicate 'when he feels like it'\n\n'He continues to improve. He's responsive and he's making good progress,' said his father, Paul.\n\nCelebrities have been quick to support the teenager, actresses Viola Davis, Jennifer Hudson and Halle Berry calling for justice.\n\nKansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said he hopes 'the justice system does right by him.'\n\nJennifer Aniston called on her followers to demand 'an immediate arrest' of the shooter.\n\nShe also posted the prosecutor's contact address and said: 'Use the contact information below to demand Prosecutor Zachary Thompson make an immediate arrest and bring the appropriate charges.'\n\nHer comment comes as a GoFundMe fundraiser set up by Yarl's aunt has raised more than $2.7million for the teenager just one day after it was created.",

Andrew Lester, 85, has been charged with first-degree assault and armed criminal action after allegedly shooting the 16-year-old in the head, prosecutors said. Ralph, described by friends as a musical prodigy due to his talents on the bass clarinet, arrived at the wrong property to pick up his younger brothers when he was gunned down.\n\nThe schoolboy mistakenly went to N.E. 115th Street – not N.E. 115th Terrace in Kansas City, Missouri where he was shot in the head. He has now been released from hospital three days after the shooting and is recovering at home. The incident on Thursday at around 10pm has sparked international outrage, with numerous celebrities voicing their support and sympathy for Ralph. Celebrities such as Viola Davis, Halle Berry and Chrissy Teigen voiced their support for Ralph. US President Joe Biden also spoke to the 16-year-old on the phone to offer his \"prayers for Ralph’s health and for justice.\"\n\nRalph was picking up his yonger brothers\n\nHe suffered life-threatening injuries\n\nRalph has now returned home\n\nRalph is a talented musician",

The law permits homeowners to protect themselves, or a third party (with exceptions) with deadly force should a person feel it is necessary. According to Missouri Revised Statutes 563.031 residents must be faced with a threat before shooting trespassers on the property. It states: '[Protective] force is used against a person who unlawfully enters, remains after unlawfully entering, or attempts to unlawfully enter a dwelling, residence, or vehicle lawfully occupied by such person.' 'Stand-your-ground' laws roughly define how an individual can defend themselves when faced with an imminent threat anywhere else; imminent being a keyword here because even threatening words towards a defending person can lead to a justified homicide.

Our children should feel safe, not as though they are being hunted.\n\n'While this is certainly a step in the right direction, we will continue to fight for Ralph while he works towards a full recovery.'\n\nThompson, asked why Lester was not charged with attempted murder, said they had decided to charge him with an 'a felony' because it was the most serious crime.\n\nLester was taken in for questioning immediately after the shooting, but was released two hours after he was arrested – without any charges.\n\nPolice took a statement from Ralph in hospital last Friday before he was released on Monday, to continue to recover at home with his mother - who is a nurse.\n\nPresident Joe Biden rang the Yarl family on Monday, and invited them to the White House when Ralph is well enough\n\nThe property also had a sign claiming it was 'protected by surveillance cameras'\n\nCleo Nagbe, with attorney Lee Merritt, said that her son Ralph Yarl is able to communicate 'when he feels like it'\n\n'He continues to improve.

                    "snippet": "Is Missouri’s \"stand your ground\" law applicable in last week’s shooting of a teenage Black boy who knocked on a white man’s door by mistake?\n\nAndrew Lester, 84, was charged Monday with two felony counts of first degree assault and armed criminal action after shooting 16-year-old Ralph Yarl, a high school student who rang his doorbell by accident, Clay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson said at a news conference. Thompson said the shooting had a “racial component.”\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting in North Kansas City, a growing number of Yarl’s supporters expressed concern that the gunman would be protected by the 2016 Missouri law, in which a would-be shooter defending life or property does not have to retreat before taking violent action.\n\n“As a mother of four, I’m completely distraught at the possibility that I could send my child to play with a friend next door and something could happen and that child would suffer instead of holding the adult accountable for their actions,” said Jalisa Davis, an organizer with Decarcerate KC, one of several grassroots groups supporting Yarl and demanding accountability.\n\n“It’s very sad that we live in a world that would function that way,” Davis said.\n\nDuring the press conference, Thompson cited the law but did not give an opinion on whether it might apply in this case. Earlier in the week, Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said investigators would consider whether Lester was justified under the \"stand your ground\" law, according to the Kansas City Star.\n\nYarl was trying to pick up his siblings around 9:45 p.m. Thursday when he mistook the Northeast 115th Street home for one a block over on Northeast 115th Terrace, police said. Yarl told them he rang the doorbell and noticed the owner took longer than expected to answer, according to one of the family’s attorneys, Lee Merritt. Merritt said the man eventually opened the door and said “Don’t come back around here” before shooting Yarl. (Lester told police no words were exchanged during the incident, according to the probable cause statement.) Witnesses told police they saw Yarl knocking on neighbors’ doors for help, according to the statement. James Lynch, who lives nearby, soon ran out to help.\n\nYarl had not gone into the home before allegedly being shot through a glass door, according to the probable cause statement.\n\nThe teen was taken to the hospital. Lester was initially taken into custody and released after 24 hours per Missouri law, which states that felony suspects can only be held up to 24 hours until charges are filed. Civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Merritt, both representing Yarl and his family, condemned Lester’s initial release from police custody in a statement early on Monday. When the felony charges were filed, an arrest warrant was issued for Lester, who surrendered himself on Tuesday afternoon, according to the Clay County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nAttorney Bill Tackett, who has worked in Missouri for nearly 40 years, said it seems unlikely the homeowner will be able to effectively use \"stand your ground\" as a defense. Tackett said it would only apply if Yarl threatened the man’s safety. He also acknowledged the state’s “castle doctrine,” which gives residents the right to defend themselves with force while inside their home.\n\n“Castle doctrine doesn’t apply unless he’s an intruder. And there’s no 'stand your ground' because there’s no threat,” Tackett said of Yarl, adding that Yarl could be classified as a trespasser but, still, shooting a trespasser would result in criminal charges.\n\nRalph Yarl. via Ben Crump Law\n\n“These doctrines don’t apply to someone who’s nonthreatening, knocking on the door on the stoop of a house. Otherwise, that means anybody who comes to your door, you can put a bullet in their head and it’s OK. You can’t do that.”\n\nThe state’s \"stand your ground\" law has been shrouded in controversy since it was passed in 2016. The law was part of a wide-ranging gun bill that also allowed people to carry concealed weapons without obtaining a permit. Missouri has seen a drastic rise in gun deaths since adopting the law, according to a February 2022 study published in the journal JAMA Network Open. “These findings suggest that adoption of SYG laws across the US was associated with increases in violent deaths, deaths that could potentially have been avoided,” the researchers concluded.\n\nLester told police he shot Yarl because he thought the teen was trying to break in, according to a probable cause statement from a Kansas City Police Department detective. But NBC News legal analyst Danny Cevallos estimated that defense wouldn’t hold up — neither would the \"stand your ground\" law nor castle doctrine — because Yarl rang Lester’s doorbell.\n\n“Burglars don’t ring doorbells,” Cevallos said. “This all comes down to defense of property, the only thing that could apply is he thought someone was breaking into his occupied dwelling. Then you can use deadly force. He rang the doorbell, that’s evidence he wasn’t trying to break in. The doorbell is very bad for the defendant here.”\n\nFlorida established the first \"stand your ground\" law in 2005 and at least 28 states and Puerto Rico have established statutes or legal precedents for the law in the 18 years since, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some of the laws come with looser gun rules. The proliferation of \"stand your ground\" laws — sometimes called “shoot first” laws — is closely linked to the National Rifle Association, which has long pressured states to adopt the laws and expand the constitutional right to self protection. Along with being linked to more firearm homicides, critics hold that the laws encourage racist vigilantism. The laws have been at the center of high profile racial violence cases like the shootings of Trayvon Martin, Jordan Davis, Markeis McGlockton and many others.\n\nNews of the shooting spread across social media over the weekend and, on Sunday, protesters marched toward the shooter’s home chanting, “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.”\n\n“It’s really telling that organizations and community members have been able to rally behind this issue,” Amaia Cook of Decarcerate KC said. “There’s been a community response. Everybody is disheartened and outraged over this horrific incident.”",

Police have said Yarl, who is Black, was shot by a White homeowner who fired at him through a glass door.\n\nHere's what to know about the case, which sparked widespread outrage.\n\nWhat happened to Ralph Yarl?\n\nYarl's aunt, Faith Spoonmore, first gave a public account of events in a GoFundMe set up for his medical expenses. She said the teen was supposed to pick up his younger twin brothers from a friend's house on 115th Terrace but went to 115th Street by mistake.\n\nHis mother, Cleo Nagbe, told \"CBS Mornings\" that the younger boys had been invited to a sleepover, but she didn't want them staying the night, so she asked Ralph to pick them up at 10 p.m.\n\nThey both said that Ralph did not have his phone on him and went to the wrong address.\n\n\"He went and rang the doorbell. And he was supposed to stay outside, and his brothers were supposed to run outside, get in the car and they come home,\" Nagbe said. \"While he was standing there, his brothers didn't run outside, but he got a couple of bullets in his body instead of a couple of twins coming up, out, and giving him a hug.\"\n\nThis undated photo provided by Ben Crump Law shows Ralph Yarl, the teenager shot by a homeowner in Kansas City, Mo. / AP\n\nCharging documents reviewed by CBS News show that Yarl told police he had rung the doorbell and waited outside, and that a man opened the door holding a firearm and immediately shot him in the head. He said he fell to the ground and was shot a second time in the arm.\n\nHe said that after he was shot and as he ran away, the homeowner said, \"Don't come around here.\"\n\nYarl said he then went to multiple residences asking for help. According to Spoonmore, it wasn't until the third house that someone called the police.\n\nThe homeowner, later identified as Andrew Lester, was detained briefly but then released while the investigation continued. On Monday, April 17, prosecutors announced he was being charged with two felony counts.\n\nAccording to charging documents, Lester, a White man who is 84 years old, said that he had just gone to bed when he heard the doorbell ring, and brought his Smith & Wesson .32-caliber revolver to answer the door. Lester told police that he saw Yarl pulling on the exterior storm door handle. Yarl said that he had not pulled on the handle. Lester said he believed Yarl was trying to break into the house, and shot twice within seconds of opening the home's main door because he believed he was protecting himself.\n\nPolice said they found blood at the scene and the glass door shattered. Officers searched the home with Lester's permission and found a Smith & Wesson .32-caliber revolver and wireless home surveillance system, but police found the system was no longer functional and had not captured video of the shooting.\n\nWhat is Ralph Yarl's condition?\n\nRalph Yarl was shot in the head above his left eye and the upper right arm, his mother said on \"CBS Mornings.\" He was discharged from Children's Mercy Hospital and is recovering at home.\n\nNagbe said the pediatrician told her a CT scan showed \"just minimal fragments of the bullet in his brain.\" She said he is able to communicate \"when he feels like it,\" but that she worries for her son's emotional state.\n\n\"Mostly he just sits there and stares and buckets of tears just rolls down his eyes,\" Nagbe said. \"You can see that he is just replaying the situation over and over again. And that just doesn't stop my tears either, because when you see your kid just sits there and constantly he just— tears are just rolling for both sides of his eyes, there's nothing you can say to him.\"\n\nHe is continuing to receive care at home from a \"team of medical professionals,\" Nagbe said. Nagbe herself is a nurse of 20 years.\n\n\"Life looks a lot different right now. Even though he is doing well physically, he has a long road ahead mentally and emotionally,\" Spoonmore wrote.\n\nShe described Ralph as \"a fantastic kid\" and said he'd been looking forward to graduating high school and hoped to attend Texas A&M to major in chemical engineering.\n\nWho is Andrew Lester?\n\nOfficials identified Lester, 84, as the suspect in the shooting. He was the sole resident of the home and was alone at the time of the shooting.\n\nA booking photo of Andrew Lester from April 18. Kansas City Police Department\n\nLester was interviewed by police and placed on a 24-hour hold on the day of the shooting, but was released in consultation with county prosecutors while the investigation continued, Police Chief Stacey Graves said over the weekend. In the charging documents, police reported that Lester said he had feared for his life when he saw Ralph Yarl at the door. He told police in his statement that he was \"scared to death\" and believed he was protecting himself from harm.\n\nThere were no words spoken between the two, police said, and Lester appears to have fired seconds after answering the door.\n\nPolice said Lester repeatedly expressed concern for the teen when they spoke with him.\n\nClay County Prosecutor Zachary Thompson said in a press conference announcing the arrest that \"there was a racial component to the case,\" though he did not elaborate.\n\nWhat charges were filed in the shooting of Ralph Yarl?\n\nIn his press conference April 17, Thompson announced that Lester was being charged with one count of assault in the first degree and one count of armed criminal action.\n\nBoth charges are felonies. The charge of assault in the first degree carries a potential punishment of up to life in prison.\n\nThompson said at the time that the suspect was not yet in custody but a warrant had been issued for his arrest, with bond set at $200,000.\n\nClay County officials said Lester turned himself in the following day.\n\nAttorney Lee Merritt, who represents Yarl and his family, told \"CBS Mornings\" that the family was happy to see the charges filed, but said it took national outrage to get this far.\n\n\"We expect all families who are met with this type of trauma to get an immediate police response and a vigorous prosecution. That's not what this family was given before there was national outcry,\" he said.\n\nMerritt also said the family wants to know why Lester was not charged with attempted murder.\n\nWhat are Missouri's self-defense laws?\n\nMissouri is a \"stand your ground\" state, which means people can use physical force to defend themselves and there is no duty to retreat.\n\nThe state's \"stand your ground\" law was passed in 2016. It states that a person may \"use physical force upon another person when and to the extend he or she reasonably believes such force to be necessary to defend himself or herself or a third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful force by such other person.\"\n\nThe law says that \"a person shall not use deadly force upon another person\" unless the first person \"believes that such deadly force is necessary to protect\" themselves against death, serious physical injury or \"any forcible felony.\" Deadly force may also be used against someone who unlawfully enters or attempts to unlawfully enter a \"dwelling, residence or vehicle lawfully occupied\" by the first person.\n\nIn Yarl's shooting, Thompson noted, \"the probable cause statement indicates the victim in the case did not cross the threshold.\"\n\nThe law also states that the defendant only needs to assert that their use of force is justified under the law. It's up to the state to \"prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not reasonably believe that the use of such force was necessary.\"",

                    "snippet": "We should not hold a United States senator to a lower standard than that to which we hold all other Americans. We should expect that a senator would, at minimum, perform the basic duties of their job, like casting votes, rather than clench power at the public’s expense (after all, it’s not like they’re Supreme Court justices, who are apparently allowed to do whatever they want). But right now, we’re watching Dianne Feinstein, the 89-year-old California senator on medical leave since February, do the latter by refusing to step down.\n\nCalifornia congressman Ro Khanna, one of the few Democrats loudly calling for Feinstein’s resignation, told me that her “stepping down from her position on the Judiciary Committee is a start, but the practical reality is that Republicans are already saying that they will stop Senator [Chuck] Schumer from filling her spot with another Democrat.” Khanna added, “With a Republican House blocking legislation, it is so critically important to confirm judges that will stand up against the ongoing assault on women’s reproductive rights. While I have a lot of respect for Senator Feinstein’s long career in public service, she is clearly unable to do her job and that puts millions of Americans at risk of losing fundamental rights.”\n\nFeinstein has been a trailblazer for women in politics, with an impressive legacy of service spanning decades. In the late 1970s, as president of San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors, Feinstein helped lead the city through the hideous murders of city supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone (whom she would later succeed). She is the longest-serving female senator ever, having now spent three decades in the upper chamber. These days, however, Feinstein isn’t in Washington, but at home in San Francisco convalescing from shingles. “I intend to return as soon as possible once my medical team advises that it’s safe for me to travel,” Feinstein said in a statement last week, though as of now, there’s been no immediate plan to do just that.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed confidence Tuesday that Feinstein would return, though “it’s just a matter of when.” Pelosi has suggested sexism is at play in the calls to resign. “I don’t know what political agendas are at work that are going after Senator Feinstein in that way,” she said last week. “I’ve never seen them go after a man who was sick in the Senate in that way.” Sure, men like the late Strom Thurmond didn’t retire before turning 100, and current Republican senator Chuck Grassley, who won reelection in November at age 89, will be 95 when his term ends. But here’s the thing: “They” should have gone after men too, if the men weren’t able to do their jobs. (Grassley seems fine; Thurmond surely could have retired at, say, 92.) This is not about ageism or about feminism; this is about holding public servants to the same standards we hold everyone else to.\n\nWhen someone is unable or unwilling to do their job, they resign—or can be expected to be fired. This is the way of life in America. It’s grim, but it’s what we do here. Imagine a world where we “hold” jobs for people who are likely never going to get back to them anyway. Your bus has no driver, your coffee place has no cashier, you go to your doctor appointment and the doctor is not there. It’s one of the harsh realities of life that we tend not to keep people in jobs when they can no longer do them.\n\nOf course, public servants should be allowed to recover from health issues, and return, as Senator John Fetterman did this week following treatment for clinical depression. In the case of Feinstein, however, her current medical condition, and the uncertainty about when she could return, follows years of questions about her fitness to serve. Here’s how one unnamed lawmaker put it last year to the San Francisco Chronicle: “I have worked with her for a long time and long enough to know what she was like just a few years ago: always in command, always in charge, on top of the details, basically couldn’t resist a conversation where she was driving some bill or some idea. All of that is gone. She was an intellectual and political force not that long ago, and that’s why my encounter with her was so jarring. Because there was just no trace of that.”\n\nBut even two years prior, in 2020, The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer told NPR’s All Things Considered: “Really, for the last couple of years, I’ve been hearing that Dianne Feinstein has been struggling, particularly with short-term memory issues, so that her staff will brief her and then she’ll forget what she’s been told or that she’s been briefed at all.” This isn’t about age, this is about ability to do the job one was elected to do.\n\nThe problem with letting Feinstein take her time is that the math is not on Democrats’ side. Republicans have refused to let Feinstein sub someone else into her Judiciary Committee slot, with every day of her not serving being another day Democrats are not confirming federal judges. And right now, America is in the middle of a judicial crisis. We have a Supreme Court which is ruled by Republicans, of which three were installed by Donald Trump—the last being Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed shortly after Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. (Democrats reportedly feared Feinstein playing a lead role in that confirmation hearing, for which she came under withering criticism after.) In June, those Trump-appointed justices overturned Roe, taking away a constitutional right women had for 50 years, the right to bodily autonomy. These right-wing justices have continued reshaping the country. According to NPR’s Nina Totenberg, it’s the most conservative Court in 90 years and conservatives have prevailed in “62% of the decisions.” These are not normal times. We are a country in the middle of a judicial emergency.\n\nAs Khanna said this past weekend on Fox News, California governor Gavin Newsom has the opportunity to appoint a caretaker to this Senate seat, thus not putting his finger on scale for the 2024 California Democratic senate primary, which already has representatives Barbara Lee, Adam Schiff, and Katie Porter vying for Feinstein’s seat. “This has nothing to do with the current race, because a caretaker would solve that,” he said. “This has to do with someone who is just not showing up.”",

                    "snippet": "CNN —\n\nRepublicans on Tuesday formally blocked a request from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to temporarily replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee, something Democrats hoped to do in order to advance stalled judicial nominations.\n\nSenate Democrats are seeking to temporarily replace Feinstein on the powerful panel that processes judicial nominees as the California Democrat remains absent, recovering from shingles.\n\nSenate Republicans, however, have made clear that they have been prepared to block Democratic efforts to replace Feinstein on the committee, ratcheting up pressure on the 89-year-old California Democrat to resign or return quickly.\n\nFeinstein’s return date is still unclear and she asked just last week to be “temporarily” replaced on the committee as she recovers.\n\nSchumer introduced his motion on Tuesday by talking about his friendship with Feinstein, and highlighting her accomplishments.\n\n“Today, I am acting not just as Leader but as Dianne’s friend, in honoring her wishes, until she returns to the Senate,” Schumer said.\n\nGOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, objected to Schumer’s request, though he also praised the California Democrat. He argued that Schumer’s move is to get more judges confirmed.\n\n“She’s a dear friend and we hope for her speedy recovery and return back to the Senate. With all due respect, my colleague, Senator Schumer, this is about a handful of judges that you can’t get the votes for,” Graham said.\n\nDemocrats could still force a vote to replace the Feinstein, but that would require the support of 10 Republicans and it’s unlikely they would use a lot of valuable floor time for something with little chance of success.\n\nFeinstein, who has already announced she’s not seeking reelection, initially said she expected to return to Washington “by the end of the March work period,” but that her return got “delayed due to continued complications related to my diagnosis.”\n\nShe recently said she plans to return “as soon as possible once my medical team advises that it’s safe for me to travel.”\n\nCardin told CNN Tuesday he had discussed with Schumer being the temporary replacement on the committee but that he had not discussed the decision with Feinstein.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat said he and Feinstein have not spoken since she’s been out of the Senate and that it is his understanding that this is only a temporary move until she returns.\n\n“I recognize the importance of the numbers on the committee, and this way we can be able to conduct business. I look at this as a way of dealing with a current situation,” Cardin said.\n\nDemocrats would need 60 votes to replace Feinstein on the panel, but senior Republicans in leadership and on the committee made clear Monday that they would not give them the votes to do that. If Feinstein does not return soon, at least 12 nominees, or possibly even more, could be stalled.\n\nIf Democrats are unable to replace Feinstein or if she does not return to Washington soon, they could see key agenda items thwarted – both on the committee and on the Senate floor.\n\nAsked if the California Democrat should consider resigning if she can’t return by May, Schumer responded that he’s “hopeful” she will return “very soon.”\n\n“Look, I spoke to Senator Feinstein just a few days ago and she and I are both very hopeful that she will return very soon,” Schumer said at his weekly policy press conference in the US Capitol.\n\nFeinstein announced in February that she would not run for reelection, and a number of Democrats have already launched campaigns for her seat in 2024 in what is shaping up to be a competitive primary.\n\nMany congressional Democrats have remained largely supportive of her decision to remain in office while absent from the Capitol as she recovers from shingles.\n\nBut Feinstein has faced calls to resign from two House Democrats – and if Democrats are not able to replace her on the committee, that number could start to grow.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin recently acknowledged to CNN that Feinstein’s absence had slowed down the party’s push to confirm nominees. But Durbin has stopped short of calling on Feinstein to resign, saying he hopes that Republicans will help to temporarily replace her on the committee and recognize that “the rain can fall on both sides of the road.”\n\nAsked if her absence has longer ramifications for the Democrats’ ability to confirm nominees, the Illinois Democrat said, “Yes, of course it does,” pointing to the long process of getting nominees scheduled for votes during precious floor time.\n\nRepublican Sen. John Cornyn, a senior member on the Judiciary Committee and close adviser to McConnell, told CNN that he opposes the effort to replace Feinstein on the panel.\n\n“I don’t think Republicans can or should help President Biden’s most controversial nominees,” the Texas Republican said. “I support having Sen. Feinstein come back as soon as she can. But this effort to confirm controversial and in many instances largely unqualified nominees, I don’t think you can expect any Republican cooperation.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

                    "snippet": "As RedState previously reported, a number of prominent Senate Republicans including some of the more moderate ones like Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) indicated in no uncertain terms that they would not support any proposal on the Democratic side to put a temporary replacement on the Senate Judiciary Committee while Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) continues her longer-than-expected recovery from the shingles virus.\n\nIn an update to this story, we’re happy to let readers know that the Senate GOP, led – surprisingly enough – by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), indeed followed through with their promise to block Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who put forth a resolution earlier calling on his Senate colleagues to allow another Senator – Maryland’s Ben Cardin – to temporarily sit in Feinstein’s place on the committee:\n\nSenate Republicans on Tuesday evening blocked a request from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to temporarily replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on the Judiciary Committee so that committee has the numbers to advance President Biden’s judicial nominees. Schumer, D-N.Y., introduced the resolution and asked that it be approved by unanimous consent – a method that requires every senator to agree. Unanimous consent allows the Senate to quickly approve non-controversial measures without hours and days of necessary debate in the upper chamber. But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., stood to oppose the move and [rejected] Schumer’s request. That objection means Democrats will need to find 60 votes to approve his request, which will require 10 Republicans to cross the aisle.\n\nNewsflash: They don’t have those votes. At least six GOP members of the Senate Judiciary Committee including Graham (who is the ranking member) have already gone on record as saying they won’t support it, and as noted above, Murkowski and Collins are also no’s.\n\nNeedless to say, this is causing a lot of heartbreak on the Democratic side, not only stalling their efforts at ramming through some of Biden’s most radical judicial picks but also their push to investigate Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas:\n\nNew Feinstein wrinkle. Democratic aide says the Judiciary Committee can’t issue a subpoena as part of a Clarence Thomas inquiry; that would require a majority on the panel and Democrats don’t have it without her. “So that option is out of the question.”https://t.co/IA1NNKVXS8 — Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) April 18, 2023\n\nHa! You love to see it, you truly do.\n\nIn remarks that were classic “Cocaine Mitch,” Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) got to the heart of the matter in his floor speech on what Democrats were really trying to do, while also suggesting what they could do instead if they wanted to get some nominees out of the committee and onto the floor for a vote:\n\n“In the meantime, our colleague’s temporary absence has not ground the Judiciary Committee to a halt. “So far this Congress, the Committee has reported out 40 judicial nominees, more than half of them on bipartisan votes. “Let me say that again: More than two dozen judicial nominees have been reported out this Congress on bipartisan votes. […] “People who are mainstream and qualified have a path forward. And yet — some of the same far-left voices who’ve attacked Senator Feinstein in the past are now suggesting that the Senate move her off the Judiciary Committee indefinitely. “The stated reason, the supposed emergency, is that Senate Democrats are unable to push through the small fraction of their nominees who are so extreme and unqualified that they cannot win a single Republican vote in Committee. “Let me say that again. The far left wants the full Senate to move a Senator off a committee so they can ram through a small sliver of their nominees who are especially extreme or unqualified. “There are four main nominees that our Democratic colleagues are currently unable to move. One of them threatened an underage abuse victim while representing her prep school. One of them didn’t know what Article II of the Constitution says… “One of them didn’t know what a Brady motion is. And the fourth one argued that the sex offender registry does not help keep children safe. “These four nominees are not on track to get bipartisan support. “It’s purely the Democrats’ political choice to hold the relatively more reasonable nominees hostage so the unqualified ones can move in a pack.\n\nIn other words, nominate candidates who are less woke in the handful of instances where there are nominations that are stalled, and then we’ll talk.\n\nAs I said before, if the shoe was on the other foot here, the Democrats would take the same position Republicans have and not budge on it, so I’m happy to see a rare moment of unity among all factions of the Senate GOP in not joining in on the Democrats’ reindeer games.\n\nYour move, Senator Chuckles.\n\nRelated: Pelosi ‘Goes There’ on the Fetterman Angle as ‘Feinstein Resign’ Drama Reaches Fever Pitch",

                    "snippet": "As RedState previously reported, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s prolonged absence from the Senate has caused major headaches for Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), especially on the issue of herding Joe Biden’s radical judicial nominees through the Judiciary Committee.\n\nFeinstein is a member of the committee, and her ongoing battle with the shingles virus has left it at a 10-10 Democrat/Republican tie since late February and with no end in sight.\n\nAs a result, three things have happened: Feinstein has faced growing calls from some of her fellow California Democrats including some in the House to resign before her term expires, Democrat infighting has commenced with thinly-veiled accusations of sexism coming from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and Feinstein has issued a statement asking Schumer to temporarily replace her on the Judiciary Committee until she is able to return.\n\nThough Schumer has declared that he intends to try and do just that this week, Senate Republicans including some of the more moderate ones as well as several on the Judiciary Committee have made it clear they aren’t going to play along with Schumer’s plan and in the process set a bad precedent going forward:\n\nAt least five Republicans on the Judiciary Committee — Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), John Kennedy (La.) and Cornyn — all said they would oppose the effort to replace the longtime California Democrat or saw no reason to remove her. Kennedy said he’d take Feinstein at her word she’ll be back soon. “I will vote against any attempt by Senate Democrats to temporarily replace Sen. Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee,” Tillis, who is often seen as among the more bipartisan senators, tweeted. “I deeply respect Senator Feinstein, but this is an unprecedented request solely intended to appease those pushing for radical, activist judges.” And Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), two of the most moderate Republicans in the chamber, may have put the nail in the coffin of the effort, though for a different reason than some others. “Sen. Feinstein has been an extraordinary senator and she’s a good friend of mine. During the last two years, there’s been a concerted campaign to force her off the judiciary committee, and I will have no part of that,” Collins said.\n\nSchumer said Monday that he’d spoken to Feinstein and that she expects to “return soon” but that in the meantime he believed Republicans “should allow a temporary replacement” because it’s supposedly the “right and fair thing to do“:\n\nChuck Schumer on replacing on Feinstein on committee: “We think the Republicans should allow a temporary replacement until she returns.\" pic.twitter.com/8CS0KdxJWu — Public News DC (@PublicNewsDC) April 18, 2023\n\nSchumer’s second in command and Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) tried to play the “decency” card on Republicans in an effort to get them to agree to temporarily replace Feinstein:\n\n“Tomorrow, this could happen to the Republicans and they could find themselves in a vulnerable position through no fault of their own,” Durbin said Monday. “And I hope that they’ll show a little kindness and caring for their colleagues.” […] Describing Feinstein as currently in “a delicate part of her life and her Senate service,” Durbin said Republicans should “stand by her and give her a dignified departure from the committee.”\n\nIt’s not gonna happen, and they know it. Republicans, even the more “bipartisan” ones Democrats normally rely on to get them out of jams like this one, are not going to comply because they know what the real goal is here and that’s to permanently replace Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee– and with that, conveniently, being the only committee they seek to replace her on.\n\nIf the shoe was on the other foot here, the Democrats would take the same position Republicans have and not budge on it, so I’m happy to see even some of the more milquetoast GOPers like Collins and Murkowski say they won’t join in on the Democrats’ reindeer games.\n\nBecause while Feinstein’s absence presumably will only be temporary, judicial appointments are long-term, with their impacts having the potential to span generations. Republicans are right not to allow emotional arguments from Schumer and Durbin to persuade them on this sensitive topic, because too much is at stake to do anything outside of playing hardball.\n\nFlashback: Chuck Schumer Fans the Flames When Asked About ‘Confidence’ in Dianne Feinstein’s Cognitive Abilities",

Dianne Feinstein on the Senate Judiciary Committee temporarily as she recovers from shingles at home.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked to move a resolution replacing her, at her request, until she can return, with Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md. The top Republican on the Judiciary panel, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R- S.C., objected and blocked the measure.\n\nGraham said he hoped Feinstein would be back soon, but that adding a Democrat to her place while she is away would allow support for \"a handful of judges that I think should never be on the bench.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier on Tuesday signaled that Republicans opposed the effort by Democrats to replace Feinstein on the committee. He said the bulk of President Biden's judicial nominees have bipartisan support and replacing Feinstein would allow Democrats to approve nominees he labeled \"unqualified.\"\n\n\"So let's be clear: Senate Republicans will not take part in sidelining a temporary absent colleague off a committee just so Democrats can force through their very worst nominees,\" McConnell said Tuesday.\n\nFeinstein, 89, has not voted since February, and says she needs more time to recuperate after a diagnosis of shingles. Democrats have raised concerns that without her vote President Biden's nominees are stalled in committee. California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna called on Feinstein to resign last week, telling NPR she was an \"absentee\" senator. Another House Democrat, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, agreed.\n\nIn response, Feinstein released a statement saying her recovery was taking longer than she anticipated, and she requested that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer replace her on the Judiciary panel until she can return for votes in Washington.\n\nMcConnell called the request by Schumer to replace Feinstein on one committee \"extremely unusual\" and called Feinstein \"a dear friend,\" a \"Titanic figure,\" and a \"stateswoman.\"\n\nMcConnell specified that there were \"a small fraction\" of nominees that cannot get any Republican votes in the committee. \"The far left wants the full Senate to move a Senator off a full committee so they can ram through a small sliver of nominees who are especially extreme or especially unqualified.\"\n\nAny move to change committee assignments would need 60 votes to pass and Democrats are operating with a slim 51-49 majority.\n\nSenate Democrats have broadly supported Feinstein's request to give her more time to recover. But without GOP support to replace her, there will likely be new pressure on Feinstein.\n\nSchumer sidestepped a question Tuesday on whether Feinstein should step down, telling reporters, \"I spoke to Senator Feinstein just a few days ago and she and I are very hopeful that she will return very soon.\"\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a member of the GOP leadership team, told reporters Monday, \"I would not support [a replacement] at all. We're not going to help the Democrats with that.\"\n\nAnother Republican, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, criticized Democrats, saying Feinstein has \"been an extraordinary senator and she's a good friend of mine. During the past two years, there's been a concerted campaign to force her off of the Judiciary committee and I will have no part of that.\"\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, a member of the Judiciary panel, said Monday, \"I hope she comes back soon. I respect her a lot. Her voters voted her in for six years and I do think this is a decision that Dianne and her constituents should make.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary committee, told NPR that the committee should press ahead with nominations and \"we will use all of the rules and tools available.\" He declined to give details but said Democrats have options. He also said Feinstein could be back \"in a couple of weeks.\"\n\nMichigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow told reporters, \"I think that she's anxious to come back and so we'll have to see. I think that she has been such - over the years - such a force, such a role model for me and that I just want her to be treated with respect, like everybody else. She'll make the right decision.\"\n\nIt's unclear what next steps Democrats will take. GOP lawmakers have also recently had absences due to medical issues. Maine Independent Sen. Angus King told NPR he could see how \"the situation may be reversed at some point in the reasonably foreseeable future.\"\n\nMcConnell recently missed several weeks in the Senate after falling and suffering a concussion and minor rib fracture in early March.",

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on the Judiciary Committee so that committee has the numbers to advance President Biden's judicial nominees.\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., introduced the resolution and asked that it be approved by unanimous consent – a method that requires every senator to agree. Unanimous consent allows the Senate to quickly approve non-controversial measures without hours and days of necessary debate in the upper chamber.\n\nBut Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., stood to oppose the move and rejecting Schumer's request. That objection means Democrats will need to find 60 votes to approve his request, which will require 10 Republicans to cross the aisle.\n\nSENATE GOP HOPES TO BLOCK SCHUMER FROM NAMING A TEMPORARY COMMITTEE REPLACEMENT FOR FEINSTEIN\n\nGraham echoed the objections of many Republicans by saying they can't support an effort to put another Democrat on the committee because it will mean Senate confirmation of liberal judges that Republicans oppose.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if Schumer would push for a roll call vote to see if 10 GOP senators would help him reach the 60 votes he needs to pass the resolution and allow Feinstein to be temporarily replaced on the committee. Schumer has said that he would want Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., in her place for the time being.\n\nSchumer told reporters during his press conference Tuesday that he was \"hopeful\" Feinstein would be back soon – but did not give a more specific timeline, or even indication that her return is a certainty.\n\n\"I spoke to Senator Feinstein just last Friday. She and I are very hopeful she will return soon,\" Schumer said.\n\nFELLOW DEMOCRATS TURN ON DIANNE FEINSTEIN, CALL FOR HER TO RESIGN FROM SENATE: 'DERELICTION OF DUTY'\n\nFeinstein has been sidelined since early March after her office announced she was being treated for shingles at a San Francisco hospital.\n\nHer absence has hamstrung Democrats’ ability to confirm Biden’s court picks, which the Senate had been doing at breakneck pace , and there is still no clear timeline on when she’s expected to be back on Capitol Hill.\n\nEven before the Monday vote, multiple senior Republican senators indicated they would not help Democrats temporarily replace Feinstein.\n\nBIDEN REFUSES TO JOIN DEM CALLS FOR SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN TO RESIGN\n\n\"During the past two years there has been a concerted campaign to force her off the committee. I think that’s wrong and I won’t be part of that,\" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters in the Senate subway on Monday evening.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a top Republican on the Judiciary committee, slammed the effort on the Senate floor that evening. His remarks also suggested that the GOP was only refusing to move on Democrats’ \"most controversial\" nominees, putting the onus on Biden to nominate more moderate picks that could get bipartisan support.",

                    "snippet": "Republicans blocked a Democratic request to temporarily replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California on the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday afternoon - effectively putting President Joe Biden's judicial nominees on ice until further notice.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, objected to a resolution by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that would have allowed another senator to take Democrat Feinstein's place as she recovers from a case of shingles.\n\nAt 89, the Senate's oldest member has been absent since February, and her office has given no date for her return.\n\nRepublicans have argued that Democrats only want a stand-in to push through the most partisan judges, noting that many of Biden's nominees have bipartisan support and can move to the Senate floor for a vote.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has not returned D.C. since February while battling shingles.\n\n'Let's be clear,' said McConnell in remarks on the Senate floor. 'Senate Republicans will not take part in sidelining a temporarily absent colleague off a committee just so Democrats can force through their very worst nominees.'\n\nThe Senate Minority Leader returned from medical leave on Monday following a five-week-long absence due to a concussion and cracked rib.\n\nThe gridlock is creating a headache for Democrats hoping to use their majority to confirm as many of President Joe Biden's judicial nominees as possible.\n\nBut her absence 'has really not ground the Judiciary Committee to a halt,' McConnell said on the Senate floor. He said the panel had reported out more than 50 nominees.\n\n'So the administration does not face any obstacle to moving nominees who are remotely qualified for the job,' he said. 'And yet some of the same far-left voices who attacked Sen. Feinstein in the past are now suggesting that the Senate move her off the Judiciary Committee indefinitely – indefinitely,' he said.\n\nAhead of the vote, Schumer said the replacement for Feinstein would be Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin, a lawyer and third-term senator from Maryland. Schumer would not answer questions about whether he thinks Feinstein should consider resigning, but said he had spoken to Feinstein and “she and I are both very hopeful that she will return soon.”\n\nFeinstein has come under increasing pressure to resign or step down from her duties. While she has defended her effectiveness, she has also faced questions in recent years about her cognitive health and memory and appears increasingly frail.\n\nRepublican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a longtime member of the panel who is almost the same age as Feinstein, chastised Democrats for denying Feinstein the opportunity to become chairman of the committee and trying to force her out of office 'because she's old.'\n\n'I don't intend to give credence to that sort of anti-human treatment,' Grassley said.\n\nSome Democrats have called for her resignation including Rep. Ro Khanna, D-California, saying it is 'unacceptable' for her to miss votes to confirm judges who could be weighing in on abortion rights, a key Democratic priority.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Pete Aguilar, said Tuesday that Feinstein is 'a legend in California politics and a legend in the Senate chamber' but that her vote will be needed as Congress tries to figure out how to raise the debt ceiling this year.\n\n'I will say that our expectation as House Democrats is that every senator is going to need to participate,' he said, adding that 'she should get to choose that timeline.'",

Schumer (D-N.Y.) that would have allowed another senator to take Feinstein’s place on the panel while the Democrat recuperates from a case of shingles.\n\nRepublicans have argued that Democrats only want a stand-in to push through the most partisan judges, noting that many of Biden’s nominees have bipartisan support and can move to the Senate floor for a vote.\n\nAs he objected, Graham said Democrats were trying to “change the numbers on the committee in a way that I think would be harmful to Senate, and to pass out a handful of judges that I think should never be on the bench.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats could still hold a roll call vote on the request. But with what appears to be unified GOP opposition to the move, it would probably be rejected.\n\nFeinstein, 89, made the unusual request last week after pressure from Democrats who are concerned about the judicial nominees and amid some calls for her resignation. She has been absent from the Senate since February and has given no date for a return, creating a headache for Democrats who are hoping to use their majority to confirm as many of Biden’s judicial nominees as possible.\n\nAhead of the vote, Schumer said the replacement for Feinstein would be Benjamin L. Cardin, a lawyer and third-term Democratic senator from Maryland. Schumer would not answer questions about whether he thinks Feinstein should consider resigning, but said he had spoken to Feinstein and “she and I are both very hopeful that she will return soon.”\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called the effort to place a substitute on the panel during Feinstein’s recovery “an extremely unusual” request with no known precedent.\n\n“Let’s be clear,” said McConnell in remarks on the Senate floor. “Senate Republicans will not take part in sidelining a temporarily absent colleague off a committee just so Democrats can force through their very worst nominees.”\n\nHis comments came after several Republican senators said Monday that they wouldn’t support the Democratic plan — both because they don’t want to help Democrats confirm liberal judges and also because they don’t think senators should try to push out one of their own.\n\nRepublican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa said they think Democrats are pressuring Feinstein unfairly.\n\nCollins said that she and Feinstein are good friends, and she thinks there has been a “concerted campaign” to push her off the Judiciary Committee. “I will have no part of that,” Collins said.\n\nFeinstein has come under increasing pressure to resign or step down from her duties. Although she has defended her effectiveness, she has faced questions in recent years about her cognitive health and memory, and has appeared increasingly frail.\n\nIn 2020, she said she would not serve as the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel after criticism from liberals about her handling of Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation. Earlier this year, she said she would not serve as the Senate president pro tempore, or the most senior member of the majority party, even though she was in line to do so. The president pro tempore opens the Senate every day and holds other ceremonial duties.\n\nGrassley, a longtime member of the panel who is the same age as Feinstein, chastised Democrats for denying her the opportunity to become chair of the committee and trying to force her out of office “because she’s old.”\n\n“I don’t intend to give credence to that sort of anti-human treatment,” Grassley said.\n\nIf Feinstein were to resign immediately, the process would be much easier for Democrats, since California Gov. Gavin Newsom would appoint a replacement. The Senate regularly approves committee assignments for new senators after their predecessors have resigned or died. But a temporary replacement due to illness is a rare, if not unprecedented, request.\n\nSome Democrats have called for her full resignation. Her statement asking for a temporary substitute came shortly after Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Fremont) called on her to resign from the Senate, saying it is “unacceptable” for her to miss votes to confirm judges who could be weighing in on abortion rights, a key Democratic priority.\n\nAnother member of the California delegation, Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Redlands), said Tuesday that Feinstein is “a legend in California politics and a legend in the Senate chamber” but that her vote will be needed as Congress tries to figure out how to raise the debt ceiling this year.\n\n“I will say that our expectation as House Democrats is that every senator is going to need to participate,” he said, adding that “she should get to choose that timeline.”\n\nAsked whether Feinstein should resign, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said Monday that “I’m not going to push her into any other decision.” Durbin previously expressed frustration about his committee’s stalled nominees.\n\nDurbin appealed to his Republican colleagues to “show a little kindness and caring for their colleague.”\n\nIf the Senate votes to replace her on the panel, “I think we can take care of this issue, do it very quickly,” Durbin said. “I hope we can find 10 Republicans who will join us in that effort.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.\n\n",

                    "snippet": "WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans blocked a request Tuesday by Democrats to temporarily replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee while the 89-year-old Californian recovers from illness.\n\nMajority Leader Chuck Schumer asked for unanimous consent to swap out Feinstein for Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., saying that Feinstein \"made her wish clear\" to be removed \"until she returns to the Senate.\"\n\nThat was met with opposition from Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, effectively dooming the request. \"This is about a handful of judges that you can't get the votes for,\" Graham, R-S.C. said, adding that he doesn't believe those judges that lack GOP support should be confirmed.\n\nThe move came at the request of Feinstein, who has been away from the Senate for months after revealing she was hospitalized with shingles. Feinstein issued the call last week in response to demands from some Democrats that she resign so that her absence doesn't stall President Joe Biden's judicial nominees from moving forward.\n\nThe blockade leaves Democrats with few options. They can still seek a full Senate vote to replace Feinstein, but that is subject to a filibuster and requires 60 votes. Republicans have made clear they'll block that as well, rejecting a temporary committee swap for the purpose of speeding up party-line judges.\n\nFeinstein has not offered a timetable to return to the Senate.\n\nSchumer said Tuesday he spoke to her on Friday and is “very hopeful that she will return very soon,” without getting specific.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., the first lawmaker who called on Feinstein to resign, citing the stalling of prospective judges as a result of her absence, doubled down on his push Tuesday.\n\n\"Senator Feinstein’s staff rushed out her statement two hours after my tweet to stop the bleeding and halt the growing chorus for her to resign. It worked for a few days but didn’t solve the problem as many of us had warned,\" Khanna told NBC News. \"The ball is now back in Senator Feinstein’s court to provide a specific timeline of when she can cast votes on Judiciary to confirm President Biden’s judges.\"\n\n\"Every day she is not on Judiciary is hurting our ability to confirm another judge who will protect women’s rights and voting rights. I hope more will choose democracy over decorum and speak out about what is painfully obvious,\" he said. \"It’s time for Sen. Feinstein to step aside to have a dignified conclusion to her public service career.\"\n\nBut other California Democrats are defending Feinstein's decision to remain in office.\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said Tuesday that it’s “up to Sen. Feinstein to decide her own timeline.”\n\nRep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., added: “In America, we don’t tell people to resign because they got shingles.”",

                    "snippet": "Republicans on Monday put up a blockade against the Democratic push to temporarily replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying there is no chance they’ll take a step that will effectively allow President Biden’s most partisan judicial nominations to advance.\n\nGOP senators of all stripes lined up in opposition Monday as they returned to the Capitol from a two-week recess partially headlined by questions about when Feinstein would be back. The six-term senator has been absent since late February due to a case of shingles, leaving the Judiciary panel deadlocked 10-10 and unable to pass partisan nominees along for floor votes.\n\n“I, for one, am not going to help President Biden’s most unqualified nominees to get confirmed. I don’t think you’ll see us help in that effort,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a senior member of the panel and a key ally of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nAt least five Republicans on the Judiciary Committee — Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), John Kennedy (La.) and Cornyn — all said they would oppose the effort to replace the longtime California Democrat or saw no reason to remove her.\n\nKennedy said he’d take Feinstein at her word she’ll be back soon.\n\n“I will vote against any attempt by Senate Democrats to temporarily replace Sen. Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee,” Tillis, who is often seen as among the more bipartisan senators, tweeted. “I deeply respect Senator Feinstein, but this is an unprecedented request solely intended to appease those pushing for radical, activist judges.”\n\nAnd Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), two of the most moderate Republicans in the chamber, may have put the nail in the coffin of the effort, though for a different reason than some others.\n\n“Sen. Feinstein has been an extraordinary senator and she’s a good friend of mine. During the last two years, there’s been a concerted campaign to force her off the judiciary committee, and I will have no part of that,” Collins said.\n\nFeinstein, 89, last week asked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to replace her on the panel, which has had to cancel three markups in her absence. Her request came shortly after Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) called for her to resign — a call Senate Democrats aren’t ready to repeat.\n\nBut replacing her on the panel while she remains a member of the Senate would require a vote of the full chamber.\n\nSchumer said he plans to bring up a resolution to replace her via unanimous consent this week. If that fails, as is expected, Democrats would need 60 votes to break a filibuster and make the change.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters that he was hopeful the requisite 10 Republicans would help their cause. He argued the shoe could be on the other foot and Republicans could be in a similar position at any time.\n\n“She’s asked to be replaced and I hope we can achieve that. … The rain can fall on both sides of the road, and Republicans ought to think a little bit about what this means. Tomorrow they may be facing the exact same thing,” Durbin said.\n\nHe noted there have been instances of a senator helping out when a colleague on the other side of the aisle has been absent by withholding their vote.\n\n“I hope so. I think it would speak well of the Senate. But I will tell you quite honestly, I’ve seen the opposite occur,” Durbin continued, pointing to the need for Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) to return to Washington in 2008 to vote on Medicare legislation over the objections of his doctors. He died a year later.\n\nDurbin did not say who he would prefer to take Feinstein’s spot and added he has not talked to Feinstein about her situation or when she could return.\n\nSchumer has said he expects her back “soon,” with Feinstein saying in her statement last week that she hopes to be back “as soon as possible.”\n\nHowever, no firm timeline is in place. Schumer declined to divulge much information on the situation during a press conference on Monday.\n\n“She believes she will return soon. She’s very hopeful of that, and so am I,” Schumer said.\n\nIn the meantime, the backlog at the committee level will continue to sit idle until something happens one way or another. There are 14 nominees who have appeared for Judiciary Committee hearings but have not received a vote from the panel.\n\nThe panel last voted to advance a nominee on Feb. 16.\n\n“I am concerned,” Schumer said, laying the blame for the situation at the feet of Republicans. “The real fault lies with Republicans. If you look at past Senates when Republicans were in charge, there has never been this kind of stonewalling of nominees who are qualified, who have good credentials, etcetera.”\n\nOne person who did not speak on the subject on Monday was McConnell, who returned to the Capitol after a five-week absence due to a cracked rib and a concussion. The GOP leader spoke about his return to the chamber and the ongoing battle to raise the debt ceiling in his floor remarks.\n\nFeinstein said shortly after her shingles diagnosis that she had hoped to return by the end of March, but she recently said that she is continuing to recuperate from the illness that can be difficult to shake.\n\nIf she is removed from the panel, the move would mark another lessening of her responsibilities in recent years as her acuity as come into question. Feinstein was the leading Democrat on the panel through 2020, but she stepped aside from that post in favor of Durbin after she was heavily criticized for her handling of judge Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n\nShe also was in line to become Senate Pro Tempore earlier this year as the most senior Democrat, but Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) filled that post instead. The position would have put Feinstein third in line for the presidency.\n\nFeinstein also announced earlier this year that she is not running for reelection.\n\n“From my judgment, this is a matter of respect for Sen. Feinstein, and it’s extremely disappointing that Republicans would want to put politics into our committee assignments, just as we would work with them if there was a situation on their side to temporarily fill a slot,” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), the No. 3 Senate Democrat.\n\n“They should be doing that for us. That’s just normal Senate courtesy,” she added.",

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on the Judiciary Committee, contending the leftists want to “pack the court with activist judges.”\n\n“I will not go along with Chuck Schumer’s plan to replace Senator Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee and pack the court with activist judges. Joe Biden wants the Senate to rubber stamp his unqualified and controversial judges to radically transform America,” Blackburn, a member of the committee, said in a statement Monday.\n\n“Senate Democrats are also attempting to upend precedent and Senate custom by abolishing home-state Senators’ right to object to Biden’s activist liberal judges. We must stand up and protect the Senate’s constitutional role to provide advice and consent on judicial nominees,” she added:\n\nSenate Democrats are also attempting to upend precedent and Senate custom by abolishing home-state Senators’ right to object to Biden’s activist liberal judges. We must stand up and protect the Senate’s constitutional role to provide advice and consent on judicial nominees. — Sen. Marsha Blackburn (@MarshaBlackburn) April 17, 2023\n\nBlackburn’s statement follows Feinstein, who has been absent well over a month while recovering from shingles, requesting Schumer to temporarily replace her on the committee in order to push Biden’s judicial nominees through.\n\n“When I was first diagnosed with shingles, I expected to return by the end of the March work period. Unfortunately, my return to Washington has been delayed due to continued complications related to my diagnosis,” Feinstein said in an April 12 statement.\n\n“I intend to return as soon as possible once my medical team advises that it’s safe for me to travel. In the meantime, I remain committed to the job and will continue to work from home in San Francisco,” she continued.\n\n“I understand that my absence could delay the important work of the Judiciary Committee, so I’ve asked Leader Schumer to ask the Senate to allow another Democratic senator to temporarily serve until I’m able to resume my committee work,” she added.\n\nSchumer signaled he would like to make the move this week.\n\n“I’d like to do it sometime this week,” he said, according to the Hill.\n\n“I spoke to Sen. Feinstein just a few days ago. She believes she will return soon. She’s very hopeful of that and so am I,” he continued. “We think the Republicans should allow a temporary replacement until she returns.”\n\n“It’s the only right and fair thing to do. That’s the correct thing to do and we hope they will do it,” he said of Republicans.\n\nSchumer’s move comes as Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) called for Feinstein’s resignation.\n\nIt’s time for @SenFeinstein to resign. We need to put the country ahead of personal loyalty. While she has had a lifetime of public service, it is obvious she can no longer fulfill her duties. Not speaking out undermines our credibility as elected representatives of the people. — Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) April 12, 2023\n\n“Maria, I don’t really see why this is actually that controversial of a position,” Khanna said during an appearance on Mornings with Maria, defending his stance.\n\n“It’s a pretty simple principle. I don’t know any job in this country where you can just not show up, have no expectation of returning, and continue to have that job. Senator Feinstein has had a distinguished public service career, but ultimately, she works for the people of California,” he said of the 89-year-old senator.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), another member of the Judiciary Committee, has also expressed opposition to Republicans assisting Democrats with temporarily replacing Feinstein on the committee:\n\nRepublicans should not assist Democrats in confirming Joe Biden’s most radical nominees to the courts. https://t.co/Dq7DFfojVi — Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) April 15, 2023\n\nIt remains unclear when Feinstein will return to her post.",

                    "snippet": "We are now in week two of the Dianne Feinstein saga, in which Democrats’ willingness to jeopardize their own agenda to accommodate the ailing absentee senator will be on full display.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, per Feinstein’s request, is asking that Feinstein be allowed to be temporarily removed and replaced on the all-important Senate Judiciary Committee, which has been gummed up for months due to her absence. The California senator was diagnosed with shingles in March, and her office does not have a timetable for her return to Washington, D.C.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe timing is crucial. Because of Feinstein’s absence, Democrats have lost their majority in the committee and have been prevented from advancing Biden’s judicial nominees—arguably the most important thing Democrats can be doing right now, especially without control of the House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchumer will need unanimous consent from the full Senate to pull off a temporary replacement. Already it looks like he won’t get it. Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and Marsha Blackburn, both of whom are actually on the Judiciary Committee, have said they will oppose it. Without unanimous consent, the other alternative is for Democrats to recruit 10 Republicans to create a filibuster-proof majority to sign off on the highly unusual mid-session change. So far, even moderate Republican senators have signaled that they’re not inclined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, it will be Republicans who decide what becomes of Feinstein. If 10 Republican allies come to her rescue, Feinstein will eventually be able to indefinitely “work from home,” per her team’s recent comments to Politico. But at least she won’t be single-handedly torpedoing the most important thing national Democrats can be doing right now. The Senate Judiciary Committee is now also tasked with holding hearings regarding the ever-expanding ethics scandals of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. And it needs a present, functioning majority to do so.\n\nOn the face of it, Republicans should be giddy that Biden’s judges are stuck in committee due to Feinstein’s absence. And they are certainly saying that they won’t help her out. But it’s possible that some might come to her aid for a more strategic reason: They may be able to finagle some assurance from Schumer that someone they like will be temporarily elevated to Feinstein’s seat on the committee. One name that keeps coming up? Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome might say that’s a fine trade for Democrats; Sinema has been a rubber stamp for Biden’s judges in the past, having never voted down a Biden judge. But this is not the same Sinema of the bygone 117th Congress. Sinema ditched her Democratic affiliation in December and has since repeatedly disparaged her former Democratic colleagues in the press. She is seemingly in a dead sprint to the right, courting big conservative donors to fund her independent reelection campaign. It’s absolutely not assured that she will behave in a favorable manner as the decisive vote on a Judiciary Committee with 11 Democrats and 10 Republicans. In fact, she could imperil the whole project. (Elevating her might also play poorly with other Senate Democrats, as Sinema would be getting a top committee appointment after repeatedly insulting her colleagues and working against them.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if Feinstein does get off of judiciary temporarily, the job of being a senator has a litany of other demands that she is effectively shirking from 3,000 miles away. And that won’t be fully resolved even after she recovers from shingles. Feinstein’s precipitous mental decline has been an open secret for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause the Senate is run by an astonishing array of largely made-up rules, there is one other course of action that would allow Feinstein to stay, explained here by the American Prospect’s David Dayen. In short, Schumer could disregard the recommendations of the Senate parliamentarian and simply enact these changes with a simple majority, known as the “nuclear option.” But he’d need full buy-in from Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema (which would be unlikely), and it would force Dems to contend with the optics disaster of having fought harder to keep an inactive 89-year-old in the Senate than for their $15 minimum wage proposal of 2021, when they refused to challenge the parliamentarian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Republicans do make good on this threat to oppose Feinstein’s temporary replacement, it’s hard to see how she could stay in office. Her absence is blocking the effectiveness of the Senate Judiciary Committee at a moment when the impact of judicial appointments and the work of the Democratic Senate has never been clearer. Both the rulings of 5th Circuit Trump-appointee Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk effectively outlawing the abortion drug mifepristone and the Clarence Thomas scandal add even more urgency to an already urgent situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, she has missed three-quarters of all votes in the 118th Congress: Some 40 million Americans in the country’s biggest and most important state currently enjoy half the representation of the 500,000 residents of Wyoming. Politico has reported that she may not make it back to the Capitol for two years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the way it ends then, not with a bang, but with a parade of eyerolls and punchlines about the obvious discrepancies between what Feinstein’s staff says and her own rare public utterances; questions about her physical and mental inability to do the job; and a constant resurfacing of her very worst political moments, including her decision to fly the Confederate flag over San Francisco as mayor. There is, to boot, a borderline insulting charm offensive being waged by some California House Democrats and Senate sympathizers who claim that pushing for Feinstein to step aside is all sexism. One particularly representative number from Rep. Norma Torres:\n\nDear @SenFeinstein please get well soon.\n\n\n\nWhen women age or get sick, the men are quick to push them aside.\n\nWhen men age or get sick, they get a promotion. #WomensRights ARE #HumanRights — Rep. Norma Torres (@NormaJTorres) April 13, 2023\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere’s no justification for Democrats to continue like this. If (when) Feinstein does resign, it will then kick off a highly contentious process in California.\n\nWhat to look forward to then?\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom pledged in 2021 to appoint a Black woman to Feinstein’s Senate seat if given the chance; after appointing Sen. Alex Padilla as Kamala Harris’ replacement for California’s other Senate seat, there is immense pressure on him to make good on that pledge.\n\nBut given that the election for Feinstein’s seat in 2024 is already well underway, and incumbents are all but guaranteed to win reelection, Newsom will almost certainly have to appoint someone who is willing to pledge not to run for reelection. Having both Senate seats indefinitely occupied by politicians who were initially appointed and not elected is a nonstarter for a state that prides itself on its democratic commitments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe simplest solution would be to appoint Oakland Rep. Barbara Lee, who is in the 2024 race and facing an early fundraising deficit. But 20 months as senator may not seem terribly enticing to Lee compared to a full six-year term. And that 20-month term also stands to get shorter and less enticing still as Feinstein’s handlers continue to insist, despite what is evident to all politics-watchers, that she is nearly better and about to storm back into D.C. in fighting form. There are many other talented and qualified Black female politicians in California, but at a certain point the offer will be almost insulting.\n\nThis dreadful outcome was entirely foreseeable when Feinstein ran for reelection in 2018. It’s why the California Democratic party opposed her. Her mental decline was understood even then, and her age meant that it was unlikely she’d get to 2024. But national party bigwigs like Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi swooped in and endorsed her anyway, because of an abiding and self-sabotaging respect for seniority. Feinstein, a fundraising maven, ran a close race despite a huge cash advantage.\n\nUntil very recently, one would have simply said that Feinstein had a historic career as California’s first female senator, one who notched some huge legislative triumphs for Democrats. But since 2018, she has been perhaps the worst offender of American political gerontocracy, overstaying her welcome and jeopardizing her own greatest accomplishments in the process. The longer this saga drags on, the more the latter will overwhelm the former. Democrats have been plenty hospitable toward Feinstein over years of her decline; it’s time she returns the favor.",

                    "snippet": "Senate Republicans blocked an effort by Democrats on Tuesday to temporarily replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein on the Senate Judiciary Committee amid a prolonged health absence that has complicated efforts to confirm President Joe Biden’s judicial nominations and prompted calls for her resignation.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer asked for unanimous consent on Tuesday to replace Feinstein on the committee with Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland. But Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, objected.\n\n\n\nPolitical Cartoons on Congress View All 222 Images\n\nWhy Are Democrats Trying to Replace Feinstein on the Committee?\n\nWithout Feinstein, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee don’t have the majority they need to quickly advance judges and face a backlog awaiting votes before the committee. Confirming Biden’s judicial nominations has become a top priority as Democrats look to keep up with the pace of former President Donald Trump, who stacked federal courts with conservative judges during his time in office. And under divided government, confirming judges is among the few things the upper chamber can accomplish without the support of the Republican-controlled House.\n\nWhy do Republicans Oppose Replacing Feinstein on the Committee?\n\nBecause replacing Feinstein would enable Democrats to confirm more of Biden’s nominees, Republicans largely oppose the effort. Some have expressed that even her resignation from the upper chamber entirely – which some Democrats have called for in recent days – would not prompt Republicans to help Democrats appoint a new member of their party to the committee because doing so would enable them to confirm more judges.\n\nWhy Have Some Democrats Called for Feinstein’s Resignation?\n\nRep. Ro Khanna of California became the first Democratic lawmaker to publicly call for Feinstein’s resignation last week, saying it had become “obvious” she could no longer fulfill her duties. Other Democrats, including Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, later joined in.\n\nIn February, Feinstein – the oldest sitting senator – announced she will not seek reelection in 2024, in a highly anticipated move that was preempted by fellow Democrats eager to get into the race for the coveted California seat she’s held for three decades. If Feinstein were to resign ahead of 2024, California Gov. Gavin Newsom would appoint a replacement to fulfill the remainder of her term.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pointed to a gender disparity last week in the calls for Feinstein’s resignation, telling reporters that she’s never seen people “go after a man who was sick in the Senate in that way.”\n\nHow Long Has Feinstein Been Away From the Senate?\n\nThe 89-year-old has been away from the Senate since shortly after a shingles diagnosis in late February. During that time, she’s missed more than 50 votes, though she’s continued to work remotely.",

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Republicans prevented Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) from temporarily replacing Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has been absent since February while recovering from shingles, on the panel with another Democrat on Tuesday evening.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) objected to the move, saying it would allow Democrats to “pass out a handful of judges that I think should never be on the bench.”\n\nThat leaves Senate Democrats still grappling with how to deal with their oldest member’s extended absence, which has resulted in some of President Biden’s judicial nominees stalling out in the Judiciary Committee without her tiebreaking vote. The powerful committee, which is probing allegations of financial conflicts of interest against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, also lacks the votes to issue subpoenas in her absence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It creates a real dilemma for us,” said Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), a member of the Judiciary Committee. “We’re stuck, if it’s [a] 10-10 [split between Democrats and Republicans]. That’s not an opinion — that’s a reality.”\n\nFeinstein has not provided a timeline for her return, but Schumer, who talked to her on the phone Friday, said he is hopeful she will return “soon.” It’s unclear if Schumer will push for a full vote on temporarily replacing her, but that would take at least 10 Republican votes to succeed that it appears he doesn’t have.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers have gingerly suggested their patience with Feinstein’s absence has an expiration date.\n\n“If we do not have any sort of timeline upon which Sen. Feinstein can be expected to fulfill her duties in Washington, then there should be a consideration about whether that’s a sustainable path forward,” said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut more Democratic lawmakers said Feinstein should be given time to recover this week, and the White House has not echoed calls for her to provide a timeline for her return.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), who has said her absence has hampered the committee, said he would not try to “push her into any other decision.”\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) called the Republican opposition to replacing Feinstein on the committee “mean” and petty but did not see it as increasing pressure on her.\n\n“In America we don’t ask people to resign because they get shingles,” he said.\n\nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee also suggested they would cross the aisle and support some of the pending judicial nominees they feel are less controversial in a committee vote Thursday, potentially defusing the talking point that Biden’s nominees are stalled. On Tuesday, Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) said he would support a Biden district court nominee in the future, which Durbin thanked him for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden, who recruited Feinstein to serve on the Judiciary Committee and considers her a long-term friend and a political ally, has also given her space. “This is a decision for her to make when it comes to her future,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at Tuesday’s White House briefing. “This is a decision she should be allowed to speak to, and we should respect that.”\n\nBiden’s own age at 80 makes it politically fraught to even gently nudge someone to retire, and he also resisted Democrats’ past calls to push Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer to resign to appoint a younger successor — making him an unlikely ally in the effort.\n\nFeinstein has withstood multiple rounds of calls for her to resign over the years, as unflattering anecdotes emerged from some of her colleagues and others about her memory lapses and her perceived cognitive decline, as well as her visible reliance on her aides in public-facing aspects of her job. But the holdup on judicial nominees created by her absence has changed the tenor of the conversation among Democratic activists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Something’s going to have to give,” said Brian Fallon, a former aide to Schumer who now leads Demand Justice, a left-leaning judicial activism group. “Just having a deadlocked committee that stalls Joe Biden’s judicial project is not an option.”\n\nFallon noted that with the House under Republican control, confirming judges quickly is the “main if not only opportunity to advance Joe Biden’s agenda.”\n\nThe situation is complicated by the ongoing race for her Senate seat among Democratic Reps. Adam B. Schiff, Barbara Lee and Katie Porter, with their allies taking opposing positions on the calls for her retirement.\n\n“‘You’re coming back when? What’s the date? How long are we going to have to wait?’ I think those are questions that should be asked,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who called on Feinstein to resign last week and is co-chairing Lee’s campaign. He called it “sad” that Feinstein had not yet retired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFeinstein’s allies, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif), who is backing Schiff’s candidacy, have long rebuffed the notion that Feinstein should step down on anyone’s terms other than her own. They have bristled at the calls for her to resign and allow California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to appoint a replacement through the end of her term — categorizing those suggestions as a sexist double standard that is not applied to aging male senators.\n\nFormer senator Barbara Boxer, who served with Feinstein from 1992 to 2017, called the refusal of Senate Republicans to give Feinstein the time that she needs to recover “disgraceful,” “divisive” and “disrespectful.”\n\n“If a Republican senator had the same situation happen to them as Senator Feinstein, she would be the very first one calling them and saying, ‘What can I do for you?’” Boxer said in an telephone interview. “What they are doing — because it’s expected, because people know the hardball they are playing — is not getting the discussion that it deserves.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeating a new senator on the committee would also take Republican votes, and while some Senate Republicans said this week they would not object to approving a permanent replacement for Feinstein, they were opposed to any temporary measure.\n\nWhile Feinstein has an insular inner circle and a fiercely protective staff, she believes her expertise on critical California issues, such as her work on the state’s complex drought and flooding issues, as well as wildfire protection and many others, make her the best person to finish out her term, according to people familiar with her thinking who, like others, spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. When confronted with questions about her ability to serve, Feinstein’s allies have long pointed out that a more junior replacement would not have her stature as the second-ranking person on the Senate Appropriations Committee, with the power to steer critical federal dollars back to California.\n\n“The Senate is a club where seniority is king, so a caretaker who is going to be there for literally a few months is not going to have the kind of clout that California needs,” said California Democratic strategist Steve Maviglio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Feinstein spokesman declined a request for comment.\n\nRepublicans’ refusal to acquiesce to Feinstein’s request for a temporary replacement also has ratcheted up the pressure on Newsom, who counts Feinstein among his mentors dating back to his earliest days in politics.\n\nNewsom, who declined a request for comment, now finds himself in a political bind if Feinstein is unable to return to the Senate. Lee, at one point among Newsom’s top prospects for a potential appointment, is now one of the three prominent Democrats vying to replace Feinstein in 2024.\n\nWith no Black women serving in the U.S. Senate after Kamala D. Harris vacated her seat in 2020 to be sworn in as vice president, Newsom faced considerable pressure to appoint a Black woman to replace her. Instead he chose Alex Padilla, who became the state’s first Latino senator. Newsom then promised to appoint a Black woman if another Senate vacancy occurred. At that time, Lee and then-Rep. Karen Bass were viewed as his top choices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Bass has been elected mayor of Los Angeles, and allies close to Newsom say it would be politically untenable for him to choose Lee, even though she is now centering her campaign to replace Feinstein on the idea that she would bring an important perspective to the job as a Black woman. Lee has distanced herself from the calls of Khanna, the co-chair of her campaign, for Feinstein to step down.\n\nNewsom allies say that he is likely to hew to his promise to appoint a Black woman to the seat if Feinstein steps aside, and that he would lean toward seeking a caretaker for that role to avoid appearing to put his thumb on the scale in the Senate race. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, Los Angeles County Supervisor Holly Mitchell and Angela Glover Blackwell, an attorney and civil rights activist who is the founder-in-residence of the advocacy group PolicyLink, are all potential candidates on his list, they say.\n\nMitchell and Blackwell did not respond to The Post’s request for comment on whether they would accept a Senate appointment should that situation arise.\n\n“Senator Feinstein has expressed her determination to serve, and we respect her decision,” a spokesman for Weber said.\n\nPorter declined to comment when asked about Feinstein on Tuesday, and her campaign aides did not respond to The Post’s questions about Feinstein’s absence. Instead her aides pointed to her comments in a recent local news interview, where she said that she believed Newsom should keep his word but demurred on whether it would be appropriate for him to appoint Lee as a potential replacement.\n\n“This is ultimately, unfortunately for me, not a decision that I have to make,” she replied.\n\nA spokesman for Schiff said he wishes Feinstein a “speedy recovery.”\n\n“He and the senator both strongly believe the work of confirming judges is paramount, and he knows she’ll do everything to get back as soon as possible,” the spokesman said.\n\nMatt Viser and Tyler Pager contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nSenate Republicans have refused to bail out Democrats’ dilemma of Feinstein’s health-related absence, which has delayed judicial confirmations. Feinstein holds a key vote on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nLast week, Feinstein told Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-CA) she could be temporarily replaced on the committee until she returns amid calls for her resignation. But at least ten Senate Republicans would have to agree on the Senate floor to replace Feinstein with another Democrat on the committee.\n\n“This is a request that we think is reasonable,” Jean-Pierre said. “This is something that Senator Dianne Feinstein asked for. This is her request.”\n\nThe press secretary ripped Republicans for using a health absence to protect America from far-left judges being confirmed by the Senate.\n\n“It is flat wrong to seek partisan health issues of a colleague,” she said. “This is something she put forward. This was her request.”\n\nWATCH: Karine Jean-Pierre Can’t Defend Biden Refusing to Comment on Trump Case:\n\nC-SPAN\n\n“She has had an impressive career,” Jean-Pierre said, noting that Feinstein can retire when she is ready. “This is a decision for her to make when it comes to her future.”\n\nThis week, Senate Republicans have soundly rejected Schumer’s attempt to replace Feinstein on the committee.\n\n“I will not go along with Chuck Schumer’s plan to replace Senator Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee and pack the court with activist judges,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) stated. “Joe Biden wants the Senate to rubber stamp his unqualified and controversial judges to radically transform America.”\n\nFeinstein has missed nearly 60 votes since her shingles diagnosis in mid-February.\n\nFollow Wendell Husebø on Twitter @WendellHusebø.

                    "snippet": "Senate Democrats are staring down a dilemma after Republicans roundly opposed the call to temporarily replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nThey’ve been left with no choice but to wait it out amid a growing backlog of judicial nominations.\n\nSenate Republicans on Monday panned the idea of filling Feinstein’s post on the panel.\n\nSome pointed to their newfound ability to block partisan judges from being voted out of the Judiciary Committee, which is deadlocked without Feinstein, and reaching the Senate floor. Others cried ageism.\n\nAnd several argued that if the six-term senator will be back “soon,” as Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Monday, there’s no need for someone to replace her for any length of time.\n\nWith the GOP not giving an inch and Feinstein, 89, not bowing to pressure to resign, Democrats are left in a tricky position.\n\nThey would love to keep the train of judicial nominations running smoothly, but they also want to respect the longest-tenured member of the Senate Democratic Caucus who is revered in many corners.\n\nIt has left them with no choice but to wait for her return.\n\n“I don’t think it’s clear yet how quickly her recovery is coming around. … If she could come back in a week or two, I think that’s fine — even several weeks,” Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) said. “She’s someone who’s served this country for a long time in a very high level. She deserves to create her own timeline.”\n\n“She knows in her heart of hearts how quickly she can get here. She knows how important it is — that we need her. So let’s give her a little time to sort through it.”\n\nFeinstein has been sidelined with shingles since senators returned from the February recess, throwing multiple wrenches into the business of the upper chamber in the meantime. The committee last voted to advance a judicial nominee on Feb. 16 and has been forced to cancel the last three markups on nominations.\n\nThere are 14 nominees who have appeared for Judiciary Committee hearings but have yet to receive a vote from the panel.\n\nThat frustration boiled over in some corners last week as a pair of House members, headlined by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), called for her to resign.\n\nAt issue now is how Senate Democrats navigate the difficult waters that the situation presents.\n\nOutside of waiting, there is no immediate plan.\n\n“I don’t know. I can’t tell you the moves on the chessboard,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told The Hill. “But we’re not going to give up giving our majority on the Judiciary Committee. We worked too hard for it.”\n\nAccording to multiple Senate Democrats, the issues surrounding Feinstein’s absence did not come up at their first luncheon after recess. Schumer reiterated afterward to reporters that he expects her back “very soon,” adding that he would try to fill her spot with Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.).\n\nHe attempted to do that via unanimous consent Tuesday evening but was blocked by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\n\nOther top Democrats also stayed mum on the situation. When asked about how the majority can manage her absence, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, simply said: “It’s up to Sen. Feinstein.”\n\nNevertheless, the party knows they have an issue at hand as they continue to struggle to advance their judicial nominees to full votes on the floor.\n\n“It’s a problem,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) told The Hill.\n\n“This is all on Dianne, more than anything, and Dianne has been here and accomplished some marvelous things, and she will have to make a decision on whether she’s going to continue or not,” Tester told reporters. “But it’s not my decision or anyone else’s.”\n\nThe already-intense GOP opposition to filling her post on Judiciary went to another level on Tuesday as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a floor speech that Senate Republicans “will not take part in sidelining a temporary absent colleague off the committee just so Democrats can force through their very worst nominees.”\n\nHe added that a “bunch” of the 14 nominees currently awaiting committee votes could win bipartisan approval, pointing to four who are “especially extreme” or “especially unqualified.”\n\nNo firm timeline has been laid out for Feinstein’s return. When she announced in early March she was released from the hospital following her shingles diagnosis, she said that she planned to return “as soon as possible.”\n\nThe open-ended phrasing has kept Capitol Hill guessing.\n\n“It’s just a matter of when,” Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reportedly told reporters on Tuesday, adding that she has kept in touch with her fellow longtime San Francisco Democrat. “With all due respect to all of the people who have served, and we owe them respect for when they are sick, for them to get well and to take the time to do it. That should apply to her as well as to all the others.”",

Feinstein to decide her own timeline,” Mr. Aguilar told reporters. “But I will say that our expectation, as House Democrats, is that every senator is going to need to participate as we stave off House Republican attempts to get closer to default [on the national debt].”\n\nMs. Feinstein, 89, has been absent since she was diagnosed with shingles in February and required hospitalization. Two House Democrats — Ro Khanna of California and Dean Phillips of Minnesota — have publicly called for her resignation so another Democrat can be appointed in her place by her state’s governor.\n\nMs. Feinstein is not seeking reelection in 2024 but has given no indication she plans to leave office early. She’s also given no return date.\n\nSEE ALSO: GOP senators say they’ll reject Democrats’ plan to replace Feinstein on judiciary committee\n\n“Shingles can be quite debilitating,” Vice Democratic Caucus Chairman Ted Lieu, California Democrat, told reporters. “In America, we don’t tell people to resign because they got shingles.”\n\nLast week, Ms. Feinstein asked the Senate to sub in another Democrat for her Judiciary seat, a rare request that would require Republican support. GOP senators have rebuffed the idea.\n\nWithout Ms. Feinstein, the committee is split, which means Mr. Biden’s nominees for the federal bench who cannot receive bipartisan support are in limbo. Senate Republicans say they’ll play no part in helping Democrats advance several “unqualified” and partisan judges by greenlighting a substitute for Ms. Feinstein as Democratic leadership refuses to advance other nominees.\n\n“It is purely the Democratic political choice to hold more reasonable nominees hostage so the unqualified ones can move in a pack,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican. “Senate Republicans will not take part in sidelining a temporarily absent member off a committee just so Democrats can force through their very worst nominees.”\n\n• Ramsey Touchberry can be reached at rtouchberry@washingtontimes.com.",

Karl Mundt represented North Dakota. He represented South Dakota. The article has been corrected. The prolonged absence of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) for health reasons poses a major challenge to Democrats as it has stalled President Biden’s judicial nominees and Republicans are unwilling to help, blocking a temporary replacement for Feinstein on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight But while Feinstein’s health problems at 89 have forced her to miss weeks and votes in Washington since February, her case is not a new one in a Congress in which senators have been absent for extended periods of time.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) returned to the upper chamber Monday after health absences. McConnell, 81, fell and suffered a concussion and a broken rib at a private dinner at a Washington hotel in early March. Fetterman, 53, was treated for clinical depression after checking himself into the hospital in February. Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) both suffered strokes last year that caused them to take brief leaves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome other notable examples throughout history have included:\n\nBeginning in 1942, Sen. Carter Glass (D-Va.) began to decline in health to the point that he could not attend committee hearings or other Senate events. But Glass refused to resign from his congressional committees and chairmanships despite his constituents petitioning the courts to remove him. He died, in office, in 1946.\n\nIn 1969, Sen. Karl Mundt (R-S.D.) suffered a stroke and was absent from the Senate for the final three years of his term in Congress.\n\nIn 1988, Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.) was rushed to the hospital for surgery for a brain aneurysm and was given Catholic Last Rites, underscoring the severity of his illness. Biden suffered a pulmonary embolism and then later a second aneurysm. His recovery kept him out of the Senate for several months.\n\nIn December 2006, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) suffered bleeding in the brain during a live radio interview and was taken by ambulance to a hospital to undergo surgery to drain the blood and stem the bleeding. Johnson spent several months in recovery and returned to senatorial duties in September 2007 to a standing ovation.\n\nIn May 2008, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor after suffering a seizure at his home. He underwent surgery in June and, after cancer treatments, returned to the Senate to work on health-care legislation. But by June 2009, Kennedy had not voted in the Senate for three months. He went on leave that month and died in August of that year.\n\nIn 2012, Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) suffered a stroke. He was absent from the Senate for nearly a year.\n\nIn 2017, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was diagnosed with a brain tumor after surgery to remove a blood clot above his left eye. He returned to the Senate less than two weeks after that surgery and cast a legacy-defining vote that preserved the Affordable Care Act. He did not vote in the Senate after December 2017, instead focusing on cancer treatment. He died in August 2018\n\nIn 2019, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was hospitalized after he suffered a heart attack during his campaign for president. Sanders’s team defended his health but acknowledged that the event would change how he campaigned.\n\nSome senators are also known to take leaves of absence without any explanation. That is especially true for senators, both Democratic and Republican, who run for president.\n\nWhile the absence of a senator has at times caused political problems for a party, it has never coalesced into a successful bid to oust a lawmaker from office. No member of Congress has ever been removed or replaced for incapacitation.\n\nFeinstein, who is recovering from shingles, gives Democrats an 11-10 advantage on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which holds confirmation hearings and advances nominations of the president’s judicial choices. With her absence, the committee is deadlocked, leaving Democrats thwarted in their effort to swiftly move nominations over Republican objections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenate rules say that for Feinstein to be replaced on the panel — a move she has requested — Democrats would have to get unanimous consent from every senator or at least 60 votes for a resolution. McConnell made clear Tuesday that he would oppose such a replacement, joining other Republicans in opposition to the move.\n\nFrustrated by the delay on filling judicial vacancies, some liberal Democrats have called for Feinstein to resign.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

                    "snippet": "The White House on Tuesday called Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s (D-Calif.) request for a temporary replacement on the Judiciary Committee “reasonable” and pushed back on Republicans using her lengthy absence as she recovers from shingles for political purposes.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre offered her first comments since Feinstein issued a statement last week requesting that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) appoint another Democrat to serve on the Judiciary Committee, where her absence has stalled several Biden administration judicial nominees.\n\n“When you think about what Democrats are doing, or what their request is, this is a request that we think that is reasonable,” Jean-Pierre said. “This is something that Sen. Feinstein asked for. This is her request.”\n\n“And it is flat wrong to seek partisan advantage from health issues of a colleague,” Jean-Pierre continued. “The American people reject that type of scorched-earth type of behavior, approach to governing. Again, this is something that she put forward. And this was her request.”\n\nFeinstein, who is 89, has been absent since late February due to a case of shingles, leaving the Judiciary panel deadlocked 10-10 and unable to pass partisan nominees along for floor votes.\n\nThe six-term senator last week asked Schumer to replace her on the panel, which has had to cancel three markups in her absence. Her request came shortly after Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) called for her to resign — a call Senate Democrats have yet to repeat.\n\nBut replacing her on the panel while she remains a member of the Senate would require a vote of the full chamber.\n\nAt least five Republicans on the Judiciary Committee — Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), John Kennedy (La.) and John Cornyn (Texas) — all said they would oppose the effort to replace the longtime California Democrat or saw no reason to remove her.\n\nSens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) have also voiced skepticism about the effort, saying Feinstein has had a distinguished career and should not be forced off the judiciary panel.",

                    "snippet": "Editor’s Note: This is an updated version of a story that originally ran on April 14, 2023.\n\nNew York CNN —\n\nIt’s April 18, the official deadline to file your federal and state income tax returns for 2022. (It is also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day for those who celebrate.)\n\nWhether you have already filed your tax return or still need to, the good news is this tax filing season has gone much more smoothly than the past three, which were hurt by the pandemic.\n\n“This is the first tax season since 2019 where the IRS and the nation were on normal footing,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a call with reporters.\n\nFor instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks to an infusion of some new funding after years of budget cuts, IRS employees have been able to answer 87% of calls from filers with questions. Last year, they answered fewer than 15%. And the wait times on those phone calls dropped to just 4 minutes this filing season from 27 minutes last filing season.\n\nThe agency also added a roster of new online tools for filers, he added.\n\nStill haven’t filed?\n\nThose online tools may be especially helpful today if you are scrambling to get your return in before midnight. Or, if you’ve come to the realization that you need to file for an extension. Either way, here are some key things to know:\n\nNot everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.\n\nThanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.\n\nIf you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.\n\nLastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return.\n\nYour paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so.\n\nOther potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:\n\nInterest on your savings\n\nInvestment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains)\n\nPay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle\n\nUnemployment income\n\nSocial Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account\n\nTips\n\nGambling winnings\n\nIncome from a rental property you own\n\nOrganize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).\n\nIf you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically.\n\nHere are some of the tax forms you may have received:\n\nW-2 from your wage or salaried jobs\n\n1099-B for capital gains and for capital gains and losses on your investments\n\n1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments\n\n1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution\n\n1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor\n\n1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600 .) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022.\n\n1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract\n\nSSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received.\n\n“Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society.\n\nOne very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.\n\nProofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer.\n\nLittle mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.\n\nWhat to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file on time, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in no later than today. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.\n\nNote, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18.\n\nSo if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by the end of today.\n\nYou can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.\n\nOr the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions.\n\nIf you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option.\n\nYou can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.\n\nIf you can’t pay what you owe in full, the IRS does have some payment plan options. But it might be smart to first consult with a certified public accountant or a tax preparer who is an enrolled agent to make sure you are making the best choice for your circumstance.\n\nIf you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.\n\nUse this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.\n\nAlready filed?\n\nIf you’ve already filed your return, you’re probably glad to have it in the rear view mirror. But you may still have a few questions about what’s ahead.\n\nWhat about my refund? If you are due a refund, the IRS typically sends it within 21 days of receiving your return. When yours does arrive, it may be smaller than last year, even if your financial life didn’t change much. That’s because a number of Covid-related tax breaks expired.\n\nSo far, the average refund paid was $2,878 for the week ending April 7, down from $3,175 at the same point in last year’s filing season.\n\nWill I be audited?: The reasons and methods for auditing a taxpayer can vary — and many audits result in “no change,” meaning you don’t end up owing anything more to the IRS. But one thing is common for the vast majority of US tax filers: Audit rates are exceedingly low.\n\nFor filers reporting incomes between $50,000 and $200,000, only 0.1% of them were audited in 2020, according to the latest data from the IRS. Even for very high income filers, audit rates were quite low: Just 0.4% for those reporting income of between $1 million and $5 million; 0.7% for those with income between $5 million and $10 million; and 2.4% for returns with income over $10 million.\n\nLooking ahead, the IRS commissioner noted in a press call that the agency will be using money from the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster its compliance efforts to focus more on auditing high-income individuals — defined as making $400,000 or more. As for filers with income below that level, he said he did not anticipate any change in the likelihood they would be audited.",

Otherwise, you could get hit with a late-filing penalty and potentially a late-payment penalty if you owe taxes and don't pay.\n\nIf you can't file by the end of the day, you should request an extension.\n\nHere's what to know about filing your taxes, requesting an extension, and paying the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nTax payment day marked on a calendar - April 18, 2022 with 1040 form, financial concept\n\nHow to file your taxes\n\nThe simplest way to avoid delays is by filing your return electronically and opting for direct deposit for your tax refund — if you're getting one. If you decide to file a paper return, it must be postmarked April 18 to be considered on time.\n\n\"In addition to e-filing, tax software helps individuals steer clear of mistakes by doing the math,\" the IRS said in a bulletin this week. \"It guides people through each section of their tax return using a question-and-answer format.\"\n\nMake sure to have all the necessary paperwork to fill out a correct return. Those include:\n\nForms W-2 from employers\n\nForm 1099-G from state unemployment offices\n\nForms 1099 from banks and other payers\n\nForm 1095-A from the Health Insurance Marketplace for those claiming the premium tax credit\n\nRecords of virtual currency transactions\n\nThere are several options to file your taxes for free if you meet certain income requirements. The IRS Free File program allows those who made $73,000 or less in 2022 to prepare and e-file tax returns for free.\n\nThe Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program — managed by the IRS — offers free tax prep for moderate- to low-income individuals, disabled individuals, senior citizens, or those who have a language barrier. The Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) program — also managed by the IRS — provides free tax help for taxpayers 60 years and older.\n\nThe agency also partners with certain online tax software companies that electronically file federal returns at no cost, with some offering free filing for state returns, too. Here are more details on filing for free.\n\nAdvocates gather in Washington, DC to call out tax prep companies like Intuit TurboTax and H&R Block for blocking simplified filing and to support Internal Revenue Service (IRS) exploration of alternative free tax filing on April 17, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for Economic Security Project)\n\nHow to file for an extension\n\nIf you need more time to file your federal tax return, you must request an extension by the tax deadline. An extension will give you six extra months — until Oct. 16, 2023 — to file your taxes.\n\nThere are three ways to request an extension — through the IRS website, using tax prep software, or by paper filing — and most can be done for free.\n\nBut remember: Filing for an extension doesn't mean your tax payment has been extended. You must still pay what you estimate you owe by April 18.\n\nMore information can be found here about filing for an extension.\n\nHow to pay your tax bill\n\nThe IRS offers many ways to pay your tax liability.\n\nYou can pay electronically through your bank account via your e-file software or through the \"Direct Pay\" function on the IRS portal. You can pay by debit or credit card through IRS-approved third-party vendors, which accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, Paypal, and Click to Pay. Fees may apply.\n\nYou can also pay by check or money order by mailing it in an envelope with the form voucher corresponding to your tax return. If you want to pay by cash, there are 7,000 participating retail partners nationwide that accept these payments. Here are more details about each option.\n\nIf you can't pay your tax liability in full by the tax deadline, the IRS offers several repayment plans, including a short-term repayment plan (less than 180 days), a longer-term installment plan (more than 180 days), and a settlement option called an offer in compromise. The last option allows taxpayers to settle their tax bill for less than what they owe, but the time-consuming process is reserved only for those who would experience undue financial hardship if they paid their entire tax liability. Learn more about your options here.\n\nWhat happens if you don't file or pay on time\n\nIn this April 13, 2014 file photo, the Internal Revenue Service Headquarters (IRS) building is seen in Washington. (AP Photo/J. David Ake, File)\n\nIf you don't file your return or pay your taxes on time, the IRS can charge two penalties: a failure to file penalty and a failure to pay penalty. Here's how those are calculated.\n\nThe failure to file penalty is equal to 5% of your unpaid taxes for each month or portion of a month that your tax return is late. The penalty doesn't exceed 25% of your unpaid taxes. If your return is over 60 days late, the minimum penalty is $435 or 100% of the tax required, whichever is less.\n\nThe failure to pay penalty is equal to 0.5% of your unpaid taxes for each month or portion of a month your tax bill remains unpaid. The penalty won’t exceed 25% of your unpaid taxes.

                    "snippet": "(NEXSTAR) – It is finally upon us – Tax Day.\n\nFor those who have already filed, April 18 is just Tuesday, but it may be a source of tremendous stress for others.\n\nIf you are worried that you might not be able to finish your taxes in time, you can file for an extension, though that’s not ideal (more on that below.)\n\nWhether you do your taxes yourself, go to a tax clinic or hire a professional, navigating the tax system can be complicated and stressful. Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate for Credit Karma, recommends you go easy on yourself.\n\n“Take a breath. Take some time, set out an hour, or go through it over the weekend. You’ll hopefully see that it’s a lot simpler than you think,” Alev said.\n\nCan I file for an extension?\n\nThe good news is that filing for an extension is pretty painless, but there’s a catch – you don’t get extra time to pay your taxes.\n\nYou can use IRS Free File, regardless of income, to file for an extension, as long as you do so by the regular due date of the return.\n\nWhile the extension pushes the return due date back to October 16 this year, if you think you owe money to the IRS you’ll still have to pay that estimated amount now.\n\nLetting the unpaid tax debt go will make you liable for penalties and interest.\n\nIf you expect to receive a refund, you will still receive your money after you file your taxes.\n\nWhat if I don’t file in time?\n\nIf you missed the tax deadline and you didn’t file for an extension, there are several penalties that you might receive. If you missed the deadline you might receive a failure-to-file penalty. This penalty will be 5% of the unpaid taxes for each month the tax return is late, according to the IRS.\n\nIf you owe taxes and you didn’t pay them prior to the tax deadline, you will receive a failure-to-pay penalty. Interest will also be charged on both taxes and penalties owed. If you are due for a refund, you will not receive a penalty and you will receive your tax return payment. If you had special circumstances that meant you were unable to file or pay your taxes on time, you might be able to remove or reduce your penalty.\n\nIf the amount of taxes you owe becomes too large, you can apply for a payment plan. Payment plans will allow you to pay off over time.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

But our editorial integrity ensures our experts’ opinions aren’t influenced by compensation. Terms may apply to offers listed on this page.\n\nKey points I hire an accountant to do my taxes because they are complicated.\n\nI'm afraid of making a mistake and owing the IRS extra money.\n\nI also don't want to spend the time to figure out how to do my taxes myself. Check out our picks for best tax software\n\nTax-filing season has just come to a close, which is a big relief. My returns have been submitted, and I've fulfilled my major obligations to the IRS for the year. Now all that's left for me to do is pay my accountant and pick up the returns that she filed for me.\n\nSee, while I could theoretically file my taxes on my own, I'm always happy to write a check out of my bank account to my tax professional. There are three big reasons why that's the case.\n\n1. My taxes are more complicated than most people's\n\nThe biggest reason that I choose to hire a tax professional to file my taxes is because they are pretty complicated. See, my husband and I both own S-corporations and pay ourselves a salary and dividend from them. This means we need to file business returns as well as personal ones. We also have some investment properties and we itemize deductions, so we need to declare specific expenses as tax deductions.\n\nTaking care of all of these issues is not as easy as just using an online tax-filing service. It would take a lot of time and effort to learn how to complete all of our forms correctly and to make sure we're getting the maximum amount of deductions and credits. My tax professional knows the ins-and-outs of the law and the filing process for our complicated returns so we'd rather just entrust her to take care of it.\n\n2. I'm afraid of getting audited and owing money if I DIY\n\nSince my husband and I are self-employed and his business is one where he collects cash, I fear that we're at a higher risk of capturing the attention of the IRS and triggering an audit. I don't want that to happen but, even more, I don't want the IRS to find we made mistakes and now owe a lot of money.\n\nBy working with an accountant, I feel more confident that we are submitting the correct information so if we are audited, we wouldn't owe a ton of back taxes. Our accountant would also be there to help us through the process.\n\n3. Learning how to file my own taxes would be a waste of my time\n\nFinally, the last big reason why I hire a tax professional to do my taxes is because it would take a lot of time for me to do them myself. And the wasted hours simply are not worth it. It would cost me more in lost working time to do the taxes myself than it costs me to pay my accountant to do them for me.\n\nUltimately, there are good tax-filing programs out there and many people can take advantage of them rather than paying a tax professional. But for those whose situations are more complex, getting the right help may be the best course of action and may be well worth the fee that an accountant would charge.",

                    "snippet": "Getty Images\n\nThe federal tax deadline for most Americans is April 18, and there's still time to file for an extension. But the clock is ticking. As of April 7, the IRS received more than 101 million returns, but the agency expects to receive in excess of 168 million through the end of the year. \"If you don't file the extension by the original deadline, you miss the opportunity,\" said Tommy Lucas, a certified financial planner and enrolled agent at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Orlando, Florida.\n\nExceptions may include filers living outside the U.S. who receive an automatic two-month extension, with a June 15 deadline, and certain members of the military who may have more time, with varying extensions, Lucas said. You may also have an automatic extension to file if you're living in an area recently affected by natural disasters, including most of California, parts of Alabama and Georgia, among others.\n\nHow to file a federal tax extension\n\nThere are several ways to file a federal tax extension if you can't make the April 18 deadline. Your state filing may need a separate extension. You can file Form 4868 electronically via IRS Free File, which provides free guided tax prep software. Anyone can use IRS Free File to request an extension, regardless of income, according to the IRS.\n\nIf you file Form 4868, it's very clear that you know exactly what you're doing. John Loyd Owner at The Wealth Planner\n\nThe second option is to make an electronic payment and select \"extension\" as the reason, which provides an automatic six-month extension without filing Form 4868, the agency says. But the first option may bypass mistakes or confusion. \"If you file Form 4868, it's very clear that you know exactly what you're doing,\" said John Loyd, a CFP and owner at The Wealth Planner in Fort Worth, Texas. He is also an enrolled agent. You can also print and mail Form 4868, but it must be postmarked by the federal filing deadline — and you may want to opt for certified mail for tracking.\n\n'Not an extension for payment'\n\nThe federal extension gives you an extra six months to file, but it's \"not an extension for payment,\" warned Linda Farinola, a CFP and enrolled agent at Princeton Financial Group in Plainsboro, New Jersey. \"You still need to estimate your taxes due and make a payment online,\" she said. Otherwise, you'll rack up a late payment penalty of 0.5% of your unpaid balance per month, capped at 25%, plus interest, which currently compounds at 7% daily.\n\nwatch now",

And whether you filed on your own using tax software or went through a tax pro, you could receive some money back through a tax refund. Tax changes in 2023 have led to slightly smaller refunds than last year, but the average tax refund is still $2,910 so far this season.\n\nOnce you've finished and filed your tax return, there's not much to do except wait for your tax refund. However, it's easy to tell when your IRS money will arrive so you can plan for it financially.\n\nWhatever format you chose for your tax refund, we'll show you how to track the status of your return and any money the IRS owes you.\n\nFor more tax tips, learn about tax breaks for homeowners and the biggest tax credits for 2023.\n\nHow do I track my tax refund?\n\nThe quickest way to monitor your tax refund is with the IRS' Where's My Refund? page, which also lets you know if your return has been rejected because of errors.\n\nTo use the IRS' tracker tools, you'll need to provide a Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, your filing status (single, married or head of household) and your refund amount in whole dollars.\n\nGo to the Get Refund Status page on the IRS website and enter your personal data, then press Submit.\n\nIf you're not taken to a page that shows your refund status, you may be asked to verify your personal tax data and try again. If all the information looks correct, you'll need to enter the date you filed your taxes, along with whether you filed electronically or on paper.\n\nMake sure it's been at least 24 hours before you start tracking an online return, or up to four weeks if you mailed your return.\n\nRead on: Best Tax Software for 2023\n\nHow do I track a refund from a previous year?\n\nThe Where's My Refund tool lists the federal refund information the IRS has from the past two years. If you're looking for return details from previous years, you'll need to check your IRS online account.\n\nFrom there, you'll be able to see the total amount you owe, your payment history, key information about your most recent tax return, notices you've received from the IRS and your address on file.\n\nUse the IRS2Go mobile app to track your refund\n\nThe IRS2Go app is available for both iOS and Android. Internal Revenue Service\n\nThe IRS also has a mobile app called IRS2Go that can monitor your tax refund status. It's available for both iOS and Android and in English and Spanish.\n\nYou're able to see if your return has been received and approved in the app, and if a refund has been sent.\n\nTo log in, you'll need your Social Security number, filing status and the expected amount of your refund. The IRS updates the app overnight, so if you don't see a status change, check back the following day.\n\nRead on: 7 Tax Mistakes That Can Get You Audited\n\nWhat does the status of my tax return mean?\n\nThe IRS tools will show you one of three messages explaining your tax return status.\n\nReceived : The IRS now has your tax return and is working to process it.\n\n: The IRS now has your tax return and is working to process it. Approved : The IRS has processed your return and confirmed the amount of your refund, if you're owed one.\n\n: The IRS has processed your return and confirmed the amount of your refund, if you're owed one. Sent: Your refund is now on its way to your bank via direct deposit or as a paper check sent to your mailbox. (Here's how to change the address on file if you've moved\n\nWhy does 'Where's My Refund' show 'Tax Topic 152' or an IRS error message?\n\nAlthough the Where's My Refund tool typically shows a status of Received, Approved or Sent, there are a variety of other messages some users may see.\n\nOne of the most common is Tax Topic 152, indicating you're likely getting a refund but it hasn't been approved or sent yet. The notice simply links out to an informational topic page on the IRS FAQ website explaining the types and timing of tax refunds.\n\nThe delay could be an automated message for taxpayers claiming the child tax credit or earned income tax credit sent because of additional fraud protection steps.\n\nTax Topic 151 means your tax return is now under review by the IRS. The agency either needs to verify certain credits or dependents, or it has determined that your tax refund will be reduced to pay money that it believes you owe. You'll need to wait about four weeks to receive a notice from the IRS explaining what you need to do to resolve the status.\n\nThere are other IRS refund codes that a small percentage of tax filers receive, indicating freezes, math errors on tax returns or undelivered checks. The College Investor offers a list of IRS refund reference codes and errors and their meaning.\n\nShould I call the IRS about my refund?\n\n\n\nGetting live phone assistance is notoriously difficult at the IRS. In 2022, only about 13% of taxpayers reached a human being, according to Erin M. Collins, the national taxpayer advocate.\n\nCongress has increased the agency's funding, and the IRS said it has hired more than 5,000 new telephone representatives. Still, the agency says you should only call if it's been at least 21 days since you filed your taxes online, or if the Where's My Refund tool tells you to.\n\nYou can call 800-829-1040 or 800-829-8374 during regular business hours.\n\nOtherwise, the IRS is directing taxpayers to the Let Us Help You page on its website and to in-person help at Taxpayer Assistance Centers around the country. You can contact your local IRS office or call 844-545-5640 to make an appointment. If you're eligible for assistance, you can also contact the Taxpayer Advocate Service at 877-777-4778.\n\nWhat does 'IRS TREAS 310' mean on my bank statement?\n\nIf you receive your tax refund by direct deposit, you may see IRS TREAS 310 listed in the transaction. The 310 code simply identifies the transaction as a refund from a filed tax return in the form of electronic payment. You may also see TAX REF in the description field for a refund.\n\nIf you see a 449 instead of 310, it means your refund may have been offset for delinquent debt.\n\nWhy was my refund mailed instead of sent via direct deposit?\n\n\n\nThere are a few reasons why your refund may be mailed rather than deposited electronically into your account. Keep in mind:\n\nYou must provide the correct account and routing number.\n\nFunds can only be deposited into an account with your name or your spouse's name (or both for a joint account).\n\nThe IRS can only direct deposit up to three refunds into one account.\n\nIf you're receiving a refund check in the mail, here's how to track it from the IRS office to your mailbox.",

                    "snippet": "A tax preparer helps a customer at an H&R Block office on Tax Day, April 18, 2017, in Brooklyn, New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nIt may be true, as Benjamin Franklin wrote toward the end of his life, that “in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes.” But while we’re all in the 100% death bracket, the federal income tax’s impact on Americans is considerably more variable – depending on one’s income level, source of income, marital status, age, residence, homeownership, parenthood and many other factors.\n\nHow we did this The American tax system manages to combine ubiquity, complexity and opacity. With the 2023 tax season nearing its end, Pew Research Center analyzed IRS data to shed light on a poorly understood topic. The IRS, by the nature of its mission, collects copious data on Americans’ financial lives. It makes much of that data available through its Statistics of Income program. We concentrated most of our research on the individual income tax – the federal government’s single largest revenue source, and what most people tend to associate with “paying my taxes.” (That said, for millions of middle- and lower-income Americans, the payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare take a bigger bite out of their gross income than income taxes do. Nor did we attempt to quantify the relative incidence of state and local taxes, such as sales tax and property tax.) The IRS data we used was derived from a stratified probability sample of all individual income tax returns filed in a given year. IRS researchers then weighted the sample data for each stratum, or subpopulation, to reflect the total number of returns in it. (The strata were defined not only by income, but also by such factors as the presence or absence of special forms or schedules.) In most cases the IRS breaks down its estimates into 18 groups by adjusted gross income, or AGI, plus a 19th group with no AGI. For much of our analysis, we combined the IRS’s AGI categories into eight larger groups, which made some underlying trends easier to see. Along with the IRS data, we relied on the Office of Management and Budget for historical data on the share of federal receipts from various sources.\n\nAll told, the federal government expects to collect about $2.33 trillion in individual income taxes this year, accounting for nearly half (48.5%) of its total receipts, according to the Office of Management and Budget. The IRS expects more than 168 million individual tax returns to be filed this year; if previous years’ patterns continue, about two-thirds of those returns will show some taxable income.\n\nTaken as a whole, the federal income tax is progressive, meaning that those with higher incomes pay at higher rates. But the system’s progressivity tends to break down at the very uppermost income levels.\n\nIn 2020, the most recent year for which the IRS has detailed data, all groups of taxpayers with $1 million or more in adjusted gross income (AGI) had average effective tax rates of more than 25%.\n\nAverage effective tax rates, defined here as total income tax as a percentage of AGI, were highest among taxpayers with AGIs between $2 million and $10 million (nearly 28%). The average effective tax rate for taxpayers with AGIs of $10 million or more was actually a bit lower (25.5%), mainly because they tend to get more of their income from dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than wages, salaries and other so-called “ordinary income.”\n\nAt the other end of the income scale, tens of millions of Americans owed little or no federal income tax, especially after factoring in the effects of refundable tax credits, such as the child and earned-income credits.\n\nIn 2020, the IRS received nearly 5.3 million individual tax returns that showed no AGI and hence no taxable income. (About 4,600 of those people ended up paying tax anyway, mainly due to the alternative minimum tax.) Another 60.3 million returns showed AGIs of less than $30,000. The average effective tax rate for those taxpayers was 1.5%, even before refundable tax credits were applied.\n\nMillions of Americans actually get money from the IRS, largely due to refundable tax credits. (This is distinct from the refunds eagerly awaited by legions of taxpayers, which typically result from more tax being withheld from people’s paychecks than they end up owing.)\n\nCredits are used to offset taxes owed – not only income tax but certain other taxes, too, such as the self-employment tax or the penalty tax on early withdrawals from qualified retirement plans. But if the value of refundable tax credits exceeds total taxes owed, the excess can be paid out to the taxpayer. This primarily benefits people with lower incomes.\n\nAfter refundable credits were figured in, taxpayers with AGIs below $30,000 (including those with no AGI or with negative AGI) collectively got back more than $78.6 billion from the IRS in 2020. For taxpayers with AGIs between $1 and $15,000, their average effective tax rate fell to ‑14.8%, from ‑10.3% in 2019, largely due to coronavirus pandemic-related federal relief efforts, some of which were structured as tax credits.\n\nSince 2000, there has been a downward trend in average effective tax rates for all but the richest taxpayers – those with AGIs of $10 million or more. But the three major tax law overhauls during this period have affected different classes of taxpayers quite differently:\n\nThe Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 benefited the highest-income taxpayers the most. Those with AGIs of $5 million or more saw their average effective tax rate drop from 27.2% in 2002 to 23.2% in 2003. Taxpayers with AGIs between $500,000 and $5 million saw their average effective rates fall from 28.8% to 25.5%. Other taxpayers with lower incomes experienced much smaller rate cuts.\n\nIn 2013, by contrast, two provisions aimed squarely at higher-income taxpayers kicked in. A new net investment income tax and Medicare surtax, enacted to help pay for the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”), helped raise the average effective tax rate on the highest-earning taxpayers (those with AGIs of $5 million or more) from 20.7% in 2012 to 27% the following year. Those with AGIs ranging from $500,000 to under $5 million also saw their average effective tax rate increase, from 24.2% to 27.5%, while other groups experienced little to no change.\n\nThe Trump tax cuts of 2017, which altered provisions throughout the tax code, had their biggest impact on upper-middle-income taxpayers: those with AGIs of at least $200,000 but less than $500,000. Although average effective tax rates fell for all income groups, they fell the most for that upper-middle group, from 19.2% in 2017 to 16.6% in 2018.\n\nBesides average effective tax rates, another way to look at the relative burden on different groups of taxpayers is by examining how much of the total bill they foot.\n\nThe IRS collected $1.66 trillion in individual income taxes in 2020 (excluding the $78.6 billion in negative tax liabilities referred to earlier). Close to 54% of that sum came from taxpayers with AGIs between $100,000 and $1 million – a group that accounted for just under a fifth of all returns filed (31.3 million), and about 30% of all taxable returns (31 million).\n\nAt the very top of the income ladder, only 0.02% of all returns filed in 2020 showed AGIs of $10 million or more, but those taxpayers collectively paid $210.2 billion in taxes after refundable tax credits, or 12.6% of total individual income tax collections.\n\nCorporate tax brings in smaller share of federal revenues\n\nAlthough the focus this time of year is on individual income taxes, corporate income taxes are also a significant source of federal revenue. This year, the Office of Management and Budget projects that the government will collect $546 billion in corporate taxes, or 11.4% of estimated total receipts. That’s less than half the corporate-tax share of total revenues that prevailed in the 1950s.\n\nSeveral big corporations, including Amazon, Nike and FedEx, have come under fire in recent years for paying little to no income tax. But comparing corporate and individual income taxes is tricky. For one thing, corporations can report income and taxes differently to the IRS than they do publicly to investors. They can also spread losses in a given year across several years’ worth of taxes – meaning, in effect, that taxes due on this year’s profits can be offset by a previous year’s losses.\n\nAlso, some types of business income generally aren’t taxed through the corporate income tax at all. Sole proprietorships, partnerships and entities called “S corporations” pass their income (or loss) through to their owner or owners, who include it in their individual taxes. In 2020, 9 million taxpayers reported income or losses from partnerships and S corporations, and 27.7 million reported income or losses as sole proprietors or self-employed professionals.\n\nThe rules governing what constitutes business or individual income, and how it should be taxed, are only part of what makes the U.S. tax code as complex as it is. One rough measure of that complexity: The printed version of the 2021 edition of the Internal Revenue Code runs a total of 4,074 pages, excluding front matter. More than half of those pages (2,448) are devoted to the income tax alone.\n\nThe tax code’s complexity is one of the biggest things Americans dislike about it. In a recent Pew Research Center survey, 53% of U.S. adults said the system’s complexity bothered them a lot. Larger shares, however, said they were bothered a lot by the feeling that some corporations and wealthy people don’t pay their fair share of taxes (61% and 60%, respectively). By contrast, 38% said they were bothered a lot by the amount they personally paid.",

In these cases, the scammer will pose as an IRS officer and take the person's details over the phone.\n\nScammers are sending text messages posing as the IRS. These include numbers to call or links that direct users to a fake website that demands payments\n\nSmishing is a text message that uses the same technique as phishing but provides a link for users to click, which is usually a fake website designed to look like an official IRS site.\n\nScammers often use alarming language like, 'Your account has now been put on hold,' or 'Unusual Activity Report' with a bogus 'Solutions' link to restore the recipient's account. Unexpected tax refunds are another potential target for scam artists.\n\nBeware of these scams Phishing: Scammers will create fake emails that look like they came from the IRS. These messages will demand payment through a link or ask people to submit their information. Phishing schemes may also tell people they need to provide banking details to receive their refund. Smishing: This is phishing by SMS and text message. Messages are often threatening and claim a lawsuit has been filed against the target by the IRS. Sometimes they claim a warrant has been issued for the person's arrest. The text will then prompt the victim to call a number or click a link. Phone calls: The caller will say the victim is eligible for a tax refund, then ask for personal information and bank details to make the payment. If it seems suspicious, or you had no reason to suspect a call, dial the hotline to report a scam.

If we don’t, we won’t. It’s just that simple.’”\n\nSome of the nation’s richest people converged in front of the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday to ask Congress to raise their taxes.\n\nJoined by lawmakers who have introduced bills to tax the wealthiest Americans, the so-called Patriotic Millionaires issued a proposal to raise taxes on rich people, arguing it would help address growing inequality and avert an uprising.\n\nAbigail Disney, a granddaughter of Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.63% co-founder Roy Disney, detailed the proposal’s three core principles: First, treat all income over $1 million the same, whether it’s ordinary income, capital gains or inheritance. Second, enact a progressive tax code, in which the tax burden increases according to income. Third, impose a wealth tax on the richest people in America. The plan also called for a 90% income tax on people making more than $100 million a year.\n\nOther members of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group that has advocated for higher taxes on the rich for more than a decade, also spoke at the news conference.\n\n“We have a request for the lawmakers in there,” said former BlackRock Inc. BLK, -0.62% executive Morris Pearl, the group’s chair, pointing to the Capitol building. “Tax us. We want to pay more taxes.”\n\nPearl lambasted the current tax system and what he called the “ludicrous notion that [tax cuts for the wealthy] creates jobs and trickles down.” “They do not,” he said. “They rig the economy, and America pays the price.”\n\nThe group’s call complemented legislation introduced by lawmakers such as Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a California Democrat who referred to Tuesday — Tax Day — as “the most segregated, most unequal, most unjust day in America.”\n\nGomez said he and Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, worked together to introduce changes to estate-tax policy. Known as the “For the 99.5% Act,” the legislation proposes an exemption for the first $3.5 million of an individual’s estate from estate tax, but proposes a progressive tax on estates worth more than that. Those with estates worth $3.5 million to $10 million would be taxed 45%, estates of $10 million to $50 million would be taxed 50%, and so on, topping out at 65% for estates worth more than $1 billion.\n\n“Those taxes should be used to create a more just society for everyone, not just the fortunate few,” Gomez said.\n\nLast week, the global charity Oxfam released a report with new numbers showing how the rich have gotten richer during the coronavirus pandemic, and also called for a federal wealth tax.\n\nSee: U.S. billionaires have grown nearly one-third richer during the pandemic, while a ‘permanent underclass’ struggles, Oxfam says\n\nOxfam, which said revenue from new taxes could be used to help working families, narrow racial wealth gaps and more, said a proposed wealth tax on billionaires alone would raise $114 billion a year. That legislation, known as the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act, proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, was co-sponsored by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state.\n\nJayapal said during Tuesday’s press conference that the nation has seen especially over the past couple of years that “poverty is a bad policy choice, and we can make a different choice.”\n\n“If any of you earn less than $50 million, you won’t pay a cent more,” the congresswoman said of the bill. “If you get to $100 million, you pay more. It would generate $3 trillion over 10 years. Just imagine what we could do with the money it would raise.” She mentioned investments in healthcare, child care, affordable housing and the environment.\n\nWhile the Patriotic Millionaires group has dozens of members, some of the nation’s wealthiest people have argued against higher taxes on people like them.\n\nFor example, Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.46% Chief Executive Musk, represented at the news conference by a life-size cardboard cutout (the other cutouts were of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.43% Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos and Meta Platforms Inc. META, -0.44% CEO Mark Zuckerberg), has said the problem isn’t that billionaires like him aren’t taxed enough; it’s that the government spends too much money. Conservative think tanks have also argued that wealth-tax proposals “punish success.”\n\nStephen Prince, the vice chair of the Patriotic Millionaires and founder of National Business Products, now known as Card Marketing Services, said at the news conference that “the poor are going to rise up, as they should. We wealthy people need to realize that we don’t need it all — we need to share.”\n\nRead next: ‘This budget sends a clear message’: Biden’s budget tax hikes give insight into his 2024 campaign pledges",

Kathy Hochul and her husband Bill raked in nearly $1 million in 2022, her first full year in office, according to the couple’s tax return released by her administration Tuesday.\n\nRecords show the couple paid $338,077 in state and federal taxes out of $984,250 in total income last year, with total taxable earnings of $910,067 at a tax rate of 29.46%.\n\nThe lion’s share of the Hochuls’ wealth comes from the $650,375 that hubby Bill Hochul, a former US attorney, received from his job at the international concessionaire Delaware North.\n\nAnother $250,314 came from the governor’s own earnings as the highest-paid state chief executive in the country.\n\nBill Hochul’s day job as a senior vice president and general counsel at Delaware North has been a source of concern since the governor took office at the end of 2021, considering the company’s size and outstanding business with the state.\n\nBut Hochul’s spouse has recused himself from matters involving the state, including a new stadium for the Buffalo Bills that the governor has championed over the past year while securing $600 million in taxpayer support for the project.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul and her husband Bill earned nearly $1 million last year while paying more than $338,077 in state and federal taxes. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nBill Hochul padded his income with $3,500 in earnings as an adjunct professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law.\n\nThe couple shared some of their wealth through $58,424 in charitable gifts last year, mostly in stocks given to nonprofits based in Western New York, where they have a residence.\n\nThat largesse includes 200-plus shares of Google’s parent company Alphabet that were given to more than a half-dozen groups such as the Buffalo Jewish Federation and Planned Parenthood of Buffalo and the League of Women Voters of New York State.\n\nBill Hochul (right) recused himself from matters involving the state, given his job at Delaware North, after his wife became governor in 2021. Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nThe Hochuls also gave $1,000 to Penn State University, where Kathy Hochul’s sister graduated and niece currently attends, as part of $3,900 in total cash gifts to charity.\n\nBut the rocky economy led to tens of thousands of dollars in capital losses for the Hochuls when they sold some of their portfolio, records show.\n\nShe also had to pay back thousands of dollars in outstanding taxes last year, after the state did not withhold enough from her paycheck, according to her office.",

This year, it falls on Tuesday, April 18 — the result of the District of Columbia’s observance of Emancipation Day on Monday and the fact that the typical deadline, April 15, fell on a weekend. Filers can still request an extension, at which point they have until Oct. 16 to submit their full return.\n\nWhere do our taxes go?\n\nPer a report from 2022, taxes go to the following:\n\nOur taxes go to protect us as was pointed out yesterday to the corrupt Democrats in the US House. Americans don’t care about parties when it comes to safety and loved ones, they care about safety. This is why we pay taxes to protect us in our neighborhoods.\n\nMs Madeline Brame: “We pay you guys, our tax dollars pay you.

The national debt as of right now is over $31 trillion.\n\nClearly, something must be done to curtail spending and preserve this country. Paying more taxes is not the answer. Ask anyone who is getting ready to pay taxes today.\n\nHere are some of the things taxes pay for:\n\nPutting Fish on Treadmills In 2017, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona released a list of the most outlandish tax splurges he could find. One involved the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, which used a $560,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to force fish to exercise to exhaustion on treadmills as part of a 2009 study. The scientists chose mudskippers because of their unique ability to use their fins like legs for extended periods of time when out of the water. The exhausted fish were then given 48 hours to rest before hitting the gym again. Different oxygen levels were used as variables to test their progress and recovery.\n\nProving That Gingerbread Houses Are Earthquake-Proof A $150,000 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services funded a workshop called “How Does the Cookie Crumble?” The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry took gingerbread houses designed to be earthquake-resistant and put them to the test on machines that replicated major temblors. Participants got to take their sweet, sugary houses with them. The workshop was part of the OMSI’s annual “Gingerbread Adventures” event. Turning Computers Into Couch Potatoes Your tax dollars paid for computers to binge-watch hundreds of hours of television during a 2016 study — as if you weren’t already burning through your paycheck on subscription services. The program — which was funded by a $460,000 grant from the National Science Foundation and other funds from the Department of Defense’s Office of Naval Research — was designed to train computers to both understand and predict human behavior. The results were inconclusive. But the good news is that the computers are all caught up on their favorite shows.\n\nFinding Out if Playing With Barbie Dolls Helps With Facial Recognition Trending: Dazed and Confused Fetterman Returns to Capitol Hill After 2-Month Absence Looking Like a Slob (VIDEO) Researchers at the National Eye Institute and National Science Foundation conducted a $300,000 study in 2016 to find out if playing with Barbies — which was more common among the women in the study — enables women to be better at recognizing faces. Since Barbies are made with different faces, scientists thought that women might have a gender-based advantage when it comes to memorizing how faces look. It turns out that they likely do not. So, that’s money that came out of your paycheck for no reason.\n\nSee more here.",

                    "snippet": "Politicians and pundits like to say that millionaires deserve tax cuts over working people because they will use their savings to create jobs, raise wages and grow the economy.\n\nI am a multimillionaire CEO who started and ran a manufacturing company, and I can say from first-hand experience that those politicians and pundits are dead wrong. Quite honestly, I think it is just self-serving nonsense that helps justify our absurdly low tax burden.\n\nWhen my wealthy peers receive their windfalls on Tax Day, they do not, by and large, take their tax savings and reinvest them back into their companies to create jobs or raise wages. Instead, they keep them all to themselves for the simple reason that they can.\n\nAll available evidence backs me up. Over the last five decades, at no point have tax cuts for the rich worked to create jobs or spur growth. Instead, they have only served to increase the ever-growing gap between the rich and the rest. Today, the top 1 percent of earners in America take home no less than 20 percent of the nation’s income. Meanwhile, 11.6 million children live in poverty and over half the country lives paycheck to paycheck. This is not an accident but rather an inevitable consequence of decades upon decades of unnecessary and misguided tax breaks for wealthy people like me.\n\nOn this Tax Day, I want to ask — nay, demand — that lawmakers end this mess and tax the rich. Spending is not our nation’s problem; revenue (taxes, or a lack thereof) is our problem.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I don’t want to pay taxes any more than the next person, particularly my fellow millionaires. And the reason I don’t want to pay taxes is the same as everyone else’s: I am greedy. I want to keep every dollar that I make for myself.\n\nBut I part with most millionaires in this country in two important ways. First, I have enough self-awareness to recognize the limitations of greed. When I have too much money and average working people — i.e. my potential customers — don’t have enough, that could spell disaster for my business. I need my customers to have enough money in their pockets to be able to buy my products. For this reason, if anyone should get a tax break, I want it to be them.\n\nSecond, most millionaires I meet genuinely want to do good with their fortunes and give back to their communities. But unlike them, I understand that governments of all types — federal, state and local — serve society in ways that I and other wealthy people cannot. Despite our best efforts and intentions, the rich could never feed and house the less fortunate. We could never educate the masses. We could never build roads, bridges and other infrastructure that society needs to grow and prosper. We could never fight wars (many of which, if not most, we shouldn’t even fight in the first place). Whether we like it or not, only the government — with its reach, organization and power — can do these things.\n\nIf we want to get serious about lifting the position of the worst-off in America and changing our economy for the better, the first thing we need to do is get serious about fixing the tax code. We need to do away with the lower rates and special loopholes and exemptions that allow billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to sometimes pay literally nothing in taxes. There is only so much good that rich people can do with money, and I want our tax code to start reflecting that reality.\n\nBut we can’t stop at home. Tax injustice and economic inequality are problems in all G20 countries, so changing the rules in just one place unfortunately won’t do the trick. We need global collaboration and coordination to avoid capital flight and share data, and this should begin in the countries that hold the most wealth.\n\nWe should also begin the process of instituting a global tax on wealth: A recent analysis conducted by the Fight Inequality Alliance, Institute for Policy Studies, Oxfam and the Patriotic Millionaires (an organization of which I am a proud member) found that a tax of up to 5 percent on multimillionaire and billionaire wealth could generate a staggering $1.7 trillion dollars annually, which could then be used to address pressing global concerns like poverty, food insecurity and climate change.\n\nEconomic inequality is the greatest crisis of our time. All the other crises facing our world — inflation, climate change, media manipulation, corruption, political polarization, etc. — can all be directly and indirectly traced back to it. That said, lawmakers should throw all their energies into tackling extreme wealth concentration, and they should take their first step in this fight by reforming tax codes worldwide.\n\nI am a greedy millionaire who is concerned about myself and the rest of the world. Tax cuts for rich people like me have never, and will never, save us. In this spirit, on this year’s Tax Day, I say emphatically: Tax me.\n\nStephen Prince founded Card Marketing Services in 1993 and is vice-chair of the Patriotic Millionaires.",

Learn More\n\nMonthly income from ASX 200 dividend shares is a great way to achieve some extra cash on the side.\n\nRio Tinto Ltd (ASX: RIO) has been paying dividends to investors for many years. Back in February 2009, the company paid total dividends of $1.015 a year to shareholders.\n\nLet’s take a look at how much I would need to invest in Rio Tino shares to generate $100 in passive income.\n\nHow many Rio Tinto shares would deliver you $100 a month in dividends?\n\nFirstly, a monthly income of $100 would equate to an annual income of $1200.\n\nRio is due to pay a fully franked final dividend of $3.2649 to eligible investors on April 20. This follows Rio paying a fully franked interim dividend of $3.8370 in September last year.\n\nThis means Rio’s total dividends in a year add up to $7.1019, a 5.8% dividend yield based on the company’s latest closing share price of $121.84.\n\nIn order to have received $1200 in a year of dividend income ($100 per month) from Rio Tinto shares, investors would need to own about 169 Rio Tinto shares (169 multiplied by $7.1019 a share equals just over $1200).\n\nAt Rio’s last closing share price of $121.84 a share, this would set an investor back $20,590.96.\n\nHowever, analysts at Goldman are predicting Rio Tinto will pay fully franked dividends of US$5.33 (A$7.91) per share in FY23.\n\nIf this eventuates, an investor would need to own 152 shares to achieve about $100 of monthly income from Rio Tinto shares. This would cost an investor $18,519.68\n\nRio Tinto share price snapshot\n\nThe Rio Tinto share price has returned 1.08% in the last year.\n\nThis ASX 200 mining share has a market capitalisation of about $45 billion based on the current share price.",

                    "snippet": "With the 2023 tax season officially coming to an end, the Internal Revenue Service is reminding last-minute filers to brace for a smaller tax refund this year.\n\nThe IRS said that it has issued about 69 million refunds as of April 7, worth a collective $198.9 billion. That is about $23 billion lower than last year, when total refunds processed were about $222.3 billion.\n\nThe average refund check so far this year is worth $2,878 – about 9% lower compared to the $3,305 average recorded last year.\n\nThe decrease in refund size can be concerning to millions of Americans who depend on the influx of money from Uncle Sam to make major purchases, save for retirement or pay off debt. On top of that, millions of taxpayers are still struggling with the worst inflation spike in a generation, which has sent the cost of staples like food, rent and gasoline soaring higher.\n\nIRS ISSUES 12 MILLION TAX REFUNDS AFTER CORRECTING FOR 2020 UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT BREAK\n\nA recent survey from Bankrate found that about 75% of adults who expect to receive a tax refund this year believe the money is important to their overall financial situation. About 43% said the refund is \"very important,\" compared to 32% who described it as \"somewhat important.\"\n\nThat is about 10 percentage points higher than in 2022, when 67% of Americans planned to rely on their refund.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the drop in refund size is that there were no extra tax credits or pandemic-related stimulus payments delivered by the federal government in 2022. In 2021, the IRS delivered a third round of stimulus payments worth up to $1,400 per person. Eligible Americans could claim unpaid funds on their tax return.\n\nEXPECTING A TAX REFUND? SMART WAYS TO USE THE EXTRA CASH\n\n\"It’s reasonable to expect that many people will receive smaller tax refunds this year,\" said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate. \"That’s mostly because many pandemic-related tax breaks have expired: stimulus payments, the expanded child tax credit and the expanded child and dependent care credit, to name a few.\"\n\nTaxpayers typically receive a refund if they had too much money withheld and overpaid their taxes the previous year. For many families, the money can be substantial: Nearly three-quarters of filers received a tax refund in 2022, with an average payment worth about $3,176 – up from about $2,800 in 2021.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"Refunds may be smaller in 2023,\" the IRS said in a November news release about preparing for the upcoming tax season. \"Taxpayers will not receive an additional stimulus payment with a 2023 tax refund because there were no economic impact payments for 2022.\"\n\nThe tax-filing season ends Tuesday, April 18 this year.\n\nEven if you receive an extension from the IRS to file your taxes, you still must pay any money owed by April 18 or face penalties and interest on any amount not paid.",

For the millions who wait until the last minute to file their returns, a pressing question is how long will it take to get that money in hand.\n\nSo far, the tax season is running more smoothly than last year, when delays and processing snarls caught millions of returns in limbo, according to tax experts.\n\nThe IRS this year has beefed up its operations by hiring 5,000 new staffers — including extra customer service agents to answer calls; and upgrading its technology, thanks to $80 billion in funding directed to the agency by the Inflation Reduction Act. That has helped deliver \"dramatically improved service\" in the current filing season, the Treasury Department said Monday.\n\nWhen will I get my tax refund?\n\nThe IRS says the vast majority of refunds are sent within 21 calendar days of filing.\n\nThat means if you wait until April 18 — the last day to file your 2022 tax return without asking for an extension — you should get your refund by May 9.\n\nHowever, that timeline applies to the 97% of people who file electronically. The IRS has warned it can take as long as 6 months or more to process paper returns.\n\nIn a best-case scenario, a paper tax return could have you waiting about four weeks for a refund, according to the IRS.\n\n\"Where's my refund?\" page\n\nYou can check the status of your refund through the \"Where's My Refund?\" page on the IRS website 24 hours after your return was filed electronically, the agency notes.\n\nTo use the tool, you'll have to provide a few basic pieces of information: Your Social Security number, filing status (such as single or married filing jointly) plus your exact refund amount.\n\nThe site will give you a \"personalized refund date\" after the agency processes your return and approves your refund.\n\nThe tracker will tell you:\n\nWhen the IRS receives your return, which means the agency is processing your tax forms.\n\nWhen the refund is approved, which means the IRS is preparing to send your refund to your bank or mail a check to you.\n\nWhen the refund is sent.\n\nIRS tax return status\n\nIt's possible that your tax return could get delayed. The IRS notes that returns that need a correction can face a holdup.\n\nThis can happen if there's an error on your return like a math mistake or tax credit that wasn't claimed correctly. In this case, the IRS says it will mail a letter to the taxpayer, rather than call, text or email.\n\nMost tax returns are processed without an issue, however. Once the tax refund is approved, the \"Where's My Refund?\" site will tell you when the IRS will send the refund to your bank. The agency says that taxpayers should wait five days until after they've sent the refund to check with their bank, since it can take a while for financial institutions to credit the money to accounts.\n\nPaper checks can take \"several weeks\" to arrive in the mail, the IRS says.",

                    "snippet": "A Roth IRA can provide a lot of advantages in retirement, but if you're not spreading your savings around to other accounts, you're probably missing out.\n\nMany savers prefer Roth accounts because distributions don't count toward your taxable income in retirement. That can save you money on taxes with proper planning.\n\nBut it's not a free ride. To receive that benefit, you must pay taxes on contributions to a Roth account today. And that cost may outweigh the benefits in retirement sometimes.\n\nIn fact, if you're only saving for retirement with a Roth IRA, you're probably missing out on big potential tax savings.\n\nA better tax-free account\n\nAs mentioned, with a Roth IRA you pay the taxes up front and then you don't have to worry about taxes in retirement. On the other hand, a traditional IRA or 401(k) can provide you a tax deduction today in exchange for paying taxes on your distributions in retirement. Roth IRAs are recommended for someone in a low tax bracket today.\n\nBut you might be able to contribute some money to your traditional IRA or 401(k), take the tax deduction today, and still pay no taxes when you take distributions in retirement.\n\nThat's because you can take the standard deduction on your taxes. In 2023, the standard deduction is $13,850 for individuals and $27,700 for married couples filing jointly. That means the first $13,850 (or $27,700) you withdraw from a traditional retirement account in retirement comes with a tax liability of $0, assuming you have no other income.\n\nSure, $13,850 isn't enough to live on, but the principal idea is that at least some of your withdrawals come out from a traditional IRA tax-free. So you pay no taxes on the contribution and you pay no taxes on the distribution.\n\nThat's a heck of a lot better than a Roth, where it's very unlikely you'll pay $0 in taxes on the amount you contribute to your account.\n\nA more flexible tax-free account\n\nYou may be able to get Roth-like benefits from a regular taxable brokerage account with the added benefit of flexibility.\n\nIf you invest in a taxable brokerage account, the big disadvantage over retirement accounts is the need to pay taxes on any dividends and capital gains accrued in the account. If you trade frequently, those taxable events can add up and eat into your investment gains over time. But if you're a long-term buy-and-hold investor, you can probably keep the taxes on the account extremely low, especially if you invest in growth stocks that pay little or no dividends.\n\nThe big advantage of a taxable account over a Roth account is that you can access your entire account balance if you need to. While it's ideal to let your balance grow as much as possible and not touch it, sometimes you need extra capital or another investment opportunity arises. Or if you simply want to retire before 59 1/2, you can withdraw as much as you need without worrying about limitations.\n\nAnother advantage is the potential to utilize tax-loss harvesting, which involves purposefully selling a security for a loss, and using that loss to write off any capital gains or up to $3,000 per year in regular income. The latter can produce significant tax savings.\n\nOnce you retire, you may be able to withdraw both your principal and earnings with no tax liability. That's because long-term capital gains are taxed at a preferred rate. And if your total taxable income remains below $44,625 (or $89,250 for married couples filing jointly) you'll owe $0 on the long-term capital gains.\n\nSo a taxable account could be just as good as a Roth account for some investors with the added benefits of flexibility and potential tax-loss harvesting.\n\nMaximize your benefits with all three\n\nWhile a Roth is a simple strategy to keep your taxes low in retirement, you may be paying a lot in taxes today for that convenience. Smart investors know that using all three -- a pre-tax retirement account, a Roth account, and a taxable account -- can provide the most flexibility and the greatest overall tax savings in retirement.",

The sum often depends on several factors including, location, home prices and tax laws.\n\nA new list from mortgage marketplace LendingTree identified how much homeowners are paying for property taxes in 50 of the nation's largest metropolitan areas.

Most of the urban areas that made the list are located in the southern United States.\n\nTake Birmingham, Alabama, for example, where homeowners pay the lowest property taxes on the list of an average of $995 a year.

But with a record-breaking increase in applications pushing acceptance rates to all-time lows, some college-bound seniors may have a tough decision to make, or pivot to back-up schools. If you didn't get the news you hoped for, \"keep an open mind,\" said Connie Livingston, the head of college counselors at college counseling firm Empowerly and a former admissions officer at Brown University. There is absolutely a path forward, she said, although it may take a little more legwork. To that end, experts share their best advice on how to frame your decision before choosing a school, including navigating a waitlist and, of course, factoring in financial aid. More from Personal Finance:\n\nHow to understand your financial aid offer\n\nThe cheapest states for in-state college tuition\n\nThis strategy could save thousands off the cost of college\n\nHow to decide on a college\n\nFor starters, settle on a few schools among the list of acceptances, based on which are the best fit in terms of cost, academics, campus life and other factors. Then, hit the road. For students who didn't get accepted at their top choice, use this opportunity to revisit other schools, advised Eric Greenberg, president of Greenberg Educational Group, a New York-based consulting firm. \"A lot of colleges have programs for accepted students and incoming freshmen, which can establish a comfort level.\" Keep in mind that you can still transfer to a school higher up on your wish list after a semester or two, he said. \"Realize that you are really making a one-year commitment,\" Livingston added. \"This does not have to be the end all and be all.\"\n\nWhat to do if you've been waitlisted\n\nHill Street Studios | Getty Images\n\nWaitlisted applicants have neither been outright rejected by a college nor have they been extended a formal offer of admission. Instead, they may be considered for a seat between now and September, depending on whether there's sufficient space for them in the incoming class, among other factors. The first thing seniors who were waitlisted should do is write a letter of continued interest to the college to let them know why they want to attend, Greenberg said.\n\nThen, provide an update since your application was submitted that demonstrates what you could bring to the table. For example, perhaps you took classes or completed a research project that helped solidify why that school is now an even better fit. \"You don't want to rehash stuff; you want to bring in new information,\" Greenberg said.\n\nFactor in financial aid\n\nAlso consider the amount of aid available. Some financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, or from programs with limited funds. Students who were admitted in the first round tend to have first dibs on grants and other forms of aid. \"Waitlist students get last dibs on financial aid,\" Greenberg cautioned. That may be the most important consideration, after all. Most college-bound students and their parents now say affordability and dealing with the debt burden that often goes hand in hand with a college diploma is their top concern, even over getting into their first-choice school, according to The Princeton Review's 2023 College Hopes & Worries survey.\n\nWaitlist students get last dibs on financial aid. Eric Greenberg president of Greenberg Educational Group\n\nA whopping 98% of families said financial aid would be necessary to pay for college, and 82% said it was \"extremely\" or \"very\" necessary, The Princeton Review found.\n\nKey takeaways for future applicants",

                    "snippet": "On the face of it, the March 30 decision could affect ACA and job-based insurance plans nationwide and a host of medical services now free for patients. Read more\n\nWhen a federal judge in Texas declared unconstitutional a popular part of the Affordable Care Act that ensures no-cost preventive care for certain services, such as screening exams for conditions such as diabetes, hepatitis, and certain cancers, it left a lot of people with a lot of questions.\n\nOn the face of it, the March 30 decision could affect ACA and job-based insurance plans nationwide and a host of medical services now free for patients.\n\nWhat does this mean, really, for people with insurance? Policy and legal experts say there are some unanswered questions and a whole lot of nuances.\n\nFirst, some background. The case, the latest legal challenge to the ACA, was brought by several individuals and an employer in Texas who argued the law’s requirement of free preventive care is unconstitutional, and also contended that requiring coverage of HIV-prevention treatment can violate employers’ religious rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor agreed with some of their arguments, declaring unconstitutional one way the recommended tests are chosen, and agreeing that requiring employers to offer preexposure prophylaxis treatment for HIV, known as PrEP, violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. But O’Connor disagreed on other points that could have eliminated no-pay coverage for such things as contraceptives and vaccines.\n\nDespite the ruling, nothing much is likely to change for enrollees in the short term, as insurers and employers are expected to be reluctant or even unable to immediately begin charging copayments or deductibles for the affected preventive care.\n\nBut as the case makes its way through the court system — both the Department of Justice and the plaintiffs have filed notices that they would appeal — here are four things to keep in mind:\n\nA lot remains uncertain\n\nBecause of the ACA, most insured people currently get preventive care that includes screening tests like mammograms and colonoscopies — along with other exams, such as checks for bone thinning in older women, depression in adults, or obesity in children — without being charged a copay or money toward a deductible. There’s a long list of qualifying services, including all those that get a top “A” or “B” recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF, an independent group of volunteer experts.\n\nBut O’Connor, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, said members of that volunteer task force, who are appointed by the director of a federal agency, are “‘officers’ of the United States” and therefore need to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Because they are not, he ruled that the use of their recommendations to set free preventive services under the ACA is unconstitutional.\n\nHere’s where things get confusing, because not all of the more than 50 task force recommendations would necessarily be affected if the ruling stands.\n\nSome policy experts said certain services would remain free of copayments or other cost sharing for patients, partly because certain tests or treatments are also recommended under guidelines from other federal agencies and are therefore not affected by the ruling.\n\nThe federal Health Resources and Services Administration, for example, sets preventive care guidelines for a host of women’s health issues, including mammograms and contraception, although there is an exemption for religious employers. Additionally, a CDC advisory committee recommends certain vaccines for children and adults. Further, cost sharing might not apply to some services because many experts expect the ruling will not impact tests or treatment recommendations made before 2010, the year the ACA went into effect.\n\n“The idea is that when Congress passed the ACA, it adopted all the recommendations from the USPSTF prior to 2010, but anything since then the judge says is not constitutional,” said Timothy Jost, law professor emeritus at Washington and Lee University School of Law, who closely follows the ACA.\n\nWhat is certain\n\nOne problem, though, is most of the recommendations have been revised, part of the task force’s ongoing work to update recommendations as new scientific evidence arises.\n\nA recent addition, for example, made in 2021, was to recommend that adults ages 45 to 49 get screened for colorectal cancer. Prior to that, the screening was aimed mainly at adults 50 and older.\n\nOne possible effect of the judge’s ruling, if it’s not overturned on appeal, is that people ages 45 to 49 might no longer be guaranteed no-copay colon cancer screenings.\n\nBut the changes could be broader.\n\nThat’s because it isn’t clear how the ruling would affect recommendations that have been revised since 2010. For instance, would any revision or update made by the task force since 2010 make the entire recommendation subject to the ruling, Jost asked, or would the ruling apply only to the change made, such as the expansion of the age for colon cancer screening?\n\n“Is everything the USPSTF touched since 2010 now unconstitutional?” asked Jost.\n\nThere may be only two pre-2010 recommendations that are unchanged since then, and both involve tests done during pregnancy to see if the blood of mothers and babies is compatible, said A. Mark Fendrick, director of the Center for Value-Based Insurance Design at the University of Michigan.\n\nNew or updated recommendations include: A 2019 recommendation that PrEP be offered to people at high risk of getting HIV, a 2021 update for annual lung cancer scans for certain current or former smokers, and screening for hepatitis C in adults ages 18 to 79, updated in 2020.\n\nIt will depend on your coverage and your geography\n\nEach insurer and self-insured employer will decide whether to reinstate copayments or other cost sharing for these services. Even if they do, it may take time for them to go into effect, especially given that policies are now in the middle of a plan year, making them contractually hard to change.\n\n“It will depend on your employer and what they want to do, and depend on whether you have a collective bargaining agreement and a whole lot of other variables,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University.\n\nThat type of varying coverage was “exactly what the ACA was designed to get away from, in order to make this more uniform for all of us,” Rosenbaum added.\n\nEven with the ruling, at least 15 states have laws requiring coverage of preventive services without cost sharing, according to an analysis by researchers at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n\nBut state rules apply only to ACA plans and job-based plans offered by employers who buy coverage from an insurer. Most large employers — and a growing number of smaller ones — self-insure and are not subject to state coverage rules.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nCongress could resolve the matter with a simple fix to the ACA, says Fendrick, of the University of Michigan. “Give the task force recommendations approval by the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and it’s done,” he said.\n\nStill, even though the preventive services coverage is very popular with consumers, the politics of changing the ACA are challenging, especially in a sharply divided Congress.\n\nIn the meantime, the case will go through the appeals process, and a final resolution could take months or even years.\n\nThe Department of Justice will seek to overturn the ruling, while plaintiffs will likely seek to broaden it, by challenging the parts of the judge’s ruling that went against them. Specifically, the individuals and employer who brought the case wanted the ruling also to cover recommendations made by other agencies, including the set of women’s health recommendations that include contraceptives.\n\n“Everything as far as we are concerned is in play,” Rosenbaum said.\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces journalism about health issues.",

                    "snippet": "Introducing Inside Voices with Kristin Messerli, a new interview video series hosting by Messerli, who’s research on NextGen homebuyers helps to inform tomorrow’s generation. She is also author of NextGen Homebuyer Research and a speaker and educator.\n\nToday, she interviews Yanely Espinal, the Education Outreach Director for NextGen Personal Finance. She shares what every leader needs to know about reaching Gen Z, and the moment that made her decide to devote her career to personal financial education.\n\nAs a child from an immigrant family, financial literacy was not something that was discussed at home, and Yanely struggled with personal finance as she entered adulthood. Conversations about personal finance can be something that starts at an early age, she says, to alleviate societal pressure and achieve confidence.\n\nYanely: I was really struggling myself with my personal finances because I’m first-generation American. I’m a daughter of immigrants. My parents are from the Dominican Republic. And so we grew up in a very traditional household. They pretty much were cash only for everything. And my parents never really had bank accounts, or debit cards, or credit cards, or anything like that.\n\nAnd so we never talked about money. And when it was time for me to go off to college, I remember my parents being like, “Okay, sweetie, you better go and get some scholarships because we don’t have any money to give you to pay for college tuition.” And being that we’re low income, I did qualify for a lot of grants and I did qualify for PELL and a lot of different programs that did cover a lot of it, but there was still so much that I didn’t know about the cost of college and how to fill out your FAFSA and how to get additional scholarship dollars. And long story short, I got really lucky and I got a full scholarship to Brown University because they had a special program for low-income students, and there was just a pot of money that was meant for some of the neediest families to be able to graduate without student loan debt.\n\nSo I was in that program. Shout out to the Sidney Frank scholarship program at Brown. It was a great experience. And what that meant is that I dodged the whole student loan experience because I never really had to take on student loans, and I never had to compare interest rates or understand what it means to take on loans like that. So when I got to college, I wanted to have a laptop and I wanted to have name brand clothes and shoes, and I wanted to get Starbucks and go to the movies with my friends. And so I got my first credit card when I was in college, and that was my first entry point into the world of personal finance. I didn’t know what it even meant to use a credit card. I had no idea. And yet, I was swiping my little credit card up and down campus, buying everything, and it got out of control really quickly.\n\nI went from $1,500 to $20,000 by the time I graduated, and I didn’t have anybody to explain to me how the compounding interest works, and how it was really growing and getting out of control. So I held onto that secret. And when I graduated and once I became a teacher, I realized this doesn’t make sense. My paycheck is not enough to pay all my bills, help out my family, get transportation to my job, pay for lunch, and also pay off these credit cards. So that was when I picked up a book about money and my real kind of education was a self-education, learning about money myself through reading books. And then later I decided, “You know what? I love teaching, but I think I want to teach specifically about financial literacy because it’s something that I never got myself when I was in school.”",

I'm requesting a tax extension.\n\nWe don't really need it. We have all our papers together in a pile on the hall table. My husband entered most of the information into our TurboTax account weeks ago. But 2021 was quite a year for us — we'd bought and sold a house, taken the child tax credit for our three children, my husband had changed jobs, and had two W-2s to contend with as well as two separate 401(k) earnings to calculate.\n\nAnd then there's me — a freelancer with half a dozen W-9s and earnings from a Canadian company that doesn't offer a cheat sheet to help me with the IRS's annual math test. There aree also the write-offs for which I'd saved receipts and a home office with more expenses I need to calculate.\n\nSee Insider's picks for the best tax software »\n\nInsider's Featured Tax Software TurboTax\n\nTaxAct\n\nFreeTax USA Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.

I tell myself I'll get my taxes in by the end of the month, but with one thing and another, and no one telling me I have to get them done until October, again, I put it off. Before I know it, the kids' summer break has come and gone, the leaves have turned red and are falling off the trees, and once again I'm at my computer frantically untangling our 2021 tax obligations.\n\nI get our taxes filed with an hour to spare. I had expected our refund to be negligible, but I'm disappointed to learn that we owe the amount I assumed we'd receive. But we can afford it, and it's six months too late to agonize over, so I write the check and move on.\n\nWe'd made a mistake and owed another $1,500\n\nWe're well into the spending frenzy of the holiday season when we receive a letter from the IRS telling us we'd miscalculated the child tax credit and we owe them another $1,500. But this time our petty cash has all been earmarked for Christmas magic, and so I put off paying the surplus until January — the same time we would typically begin working on our taxes for the previous year.\n\nExcept in January, all of my freelance jobs begin flooding my inbox with earning statements, and it soon becomes clear that if we'd owed a little for 2021, we're going to owe a whole lot more for 2022. I can't do it. I decide to set up a payment plan with the IRS for 2021, and this year we'll once again request an extension.\n\nI have a plan, but I'm worried about it\n\nI have a plan. We'll pay off 2021 by summer, hire a CPA to help us with 2022, and have those taxes paid by fall. If everything goes according to plan, we'll be back on track in time to handle 2023 taxes on time. Except we have a 10-day summer vacation planned, three summer birthdays to celebrate, and the unforeseen medical expenses that are inevitable when you have three children. I worry about our ability to stick with the plan.\n\nIf I could go back in time, I would never let those six months blur past me while I blithely waited for the pressure of the second tax deadline. I would make the time, I would find the energy, gather the paperwork, and double-check my math. But since I can't do that, all I can do is fight my way out of the stressful cycle I jumped into last spring and never let it happen again.\n\nDon't rest on your laurels\n\nApplying for the extension can be a smart way to take your time and make sure you get your taxes done well in a way that works for you. But as my experience shows, it can also be a way of enabling ourselves in our worst propensities. Like my desire to avoid the doom pile on my entryway table.\n\nThe key difference isn't whether or not to apply for an extension — the difference is that if you do get an extension, don't rest on your laurels. Get your taxes filed sooner rather than later, so they don't hang on your back like a 500-pound gorilla for the rest of the year.\n\nBased on the type of miscalculation we made, chances are even if we had filed our taxes by, or even shortly after, the April deadline, we would have made the same mistake and still owed more money than we were anticipating. But we would have had almost a full year to pay it off. And on a personal note, we actually had a bit of a windfall last spring that would have made the payment hurt a whole lot less than it's going to hurt this year.\n\nI'm being proactive this year\n\nBy waiting for the October extended deadline, we got the letter from the IRS on the same day we received our personal property tax bill from the county, and of course, during the thick of holiday shopping. When it comes to money, timing is everything. And due to a summer's long choice to \"file my taxes tomorrow\", I screwed up our timing completely.\n\nSo, here we are in April 2023. The tax deadline is here, and many of us (myself included) have asked for an extension. This time, I plan to be proactive about the extension and use the extra time wisely, rather than using it as a way to avoid searching through my email for the 1099 I swear I remember receiving. I would encourage you to learn from my mistake and do the same.",

                    "snippet": "The 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup is officially just under100 days away, and the U.S. Women’s National Team is riding an eight-match win streak as the four-time champions prepare to defend their 2019 title this July in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe 32-team field for the Women’s World Cup is set after February’s play-in tournament, where Portugal, Haiti and Panama emerged victorious from their respective groups to earn the final three spots in 2023 tournament. This year marks the first time the Women’s World Cup will feature 32 teams – eight more than in 2019. Several nations will make their debut, including Vietnam, which faces the USWNT in its opening group-stage match on July 22 at Eden Park in Auckland. The tournament kicks off with a doubleheader on July 20, with co-hosts New Zealand and Australia taking on Norway and the Republic of Ireland, respectively.\n\nTeam USA kicked off 2023 in New Zealand, where they shut out the co-host nation 4-0 on Jan. 17 and and 5-0 on Jan. 20. The USWNT followed up in February with three straight wins to secure its fourth consecutive SheBelieves Cup title, beating No. 6-ranked Canada (2-0), No. 11 Japan (1-0) and No. 9 Brazil (2-1). Most recently, the U.S. beat the Republic of Ireland in two friendlies on home soil, winning 2-0 on April 8 and 1-0 on April 12 in what was the USA’s final friendly before head coach Vlatko Andonovski selects his 23-player roster for the 2023 World Cup.\n\nPerhaps the biggest news 100 days out is the injury of Mallory Swanson, who suffered a torn patella tendon in her left knee Saturday during the USA’s win over Ireland and had surgery on Tuesday. Swanson was leading the USWNT in scoring this year, with seven goals in five games — already tied for the most goals she’s ever scored in a calendar year for the U.S. She entered the match in Austin on a six-game scoring streak, tied for the fourth longest streak by any player in USWNT history and the longest since Christen Press had a six-game scoring streak from November 2019 to February 2020.\n\nSwanson was replaced on the roster by 18-year-old forward Alyssa Thompson, who made headlines as the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL Draft by Angel City FC and becoming the youngest draftee in league history. Thompson, who was part of the “Starting XI” Tuesday, made her USWNT debut last October in front of more than 76,000 fans at Wembley Stadium in London, coming into the match against England in the second half. She also came in off the bench against Spain four days later for her second cap.\n\n“[Thompson] is an exciting player,” Andonovski said. “She has abilities to turn in small areas that not many players have. And it’s not just the turn, but she accelerates with the ball and runs at defenses with confidence. I almost want to say sometimes, for an 18-year-old, it’s borderline arrogant when she goes at you.”\n\nAlso making their return to the mix are veterans Julie Ertz, who gave birth to her first child (a boy) last August and made her first cap in 611 days on April 8, and defender Kelley O’Hara, a two-time World Cup winner who returned from injury and was named to the Starting XI for the April 11 friendly, marking her first cap for the U.S. since last summer. Also getting caps as subs on Tuesday were Casey Krueger, who gave birth to her first child (a boy) in July 2022 and was in her first USWNT camp since October 2021; and World Cup champion defender Tierna Davidson, who trained with the USWNT before the 2023 SheBelieves Cup but had yet to see action since recovering from ACL surgery.\n\nAs for prize money, FIFA announced in March a $150 million prize purse for the 2023 tournament, a significant increase from the $30 million four years ago in France. The U.S. women took home $4 million for winning their second straight World Cup in 2019 — a far cry from $42 million that Argentina won for the 2022 men’s World Cup, which featured a $440 million purse.\n\nRead on as On Her Turf breaks down what you need to know heading into the ninth edition of the FIFA Women’s World Cup.\n\nThe upcoming Women’s World Cup is set for July 20 to Aug. 20, with matches taking place in Australia and New Zealand. Telemundo will be the exclusive Spanish-language home of the tournament, with streaming also available on Peacock.\n\nVeterans and fresh faces highlight USWNT roster, but questions remain\n\nThe U.S. women will be led by star veterans including 37-year-old Megan Rapinoe, winner of the Golden Boot and Golden Ball in 2019, Alex Morgan, Becky Sauerbrunn and Alyssa Naeher.\n\nIn positive developments ahead of the USA’s series vs. Ireland, the roster also featured the return of two-time World Cup champion Julie Ertz and 2022 BioSteel U.S. Soccer Female Player of the Year and 2022 NWSL MVP Sophia Smith, both of whom made their return to action April 8 after extended absences on the USWNT roster. The 22-year-old Smith, who opened the 2023 NWSL season with four goals and one assist in two games for the Portland Thorns, returned after missing the year’s first two USWNT events due to a foot injury, and played the entire game.\n\nThe 31-year-old Ertz played on April 8 for her first cap in 611 days, making her first national-team appearance since the bronze-medal match of the Tokyo Olympics in 2022. But Ertz, who gave birth to her first child — a son — in August 2022, still has to prove herself to Andonovski, who noted: “Nothing is going to be given.” Ertz hasn’t played for an NWSL team since the 2021 season with the Chicago Red Stars and admitted: “I’m trying to stay focused on the games coming up, but also knowing that I need a club team.”\n\nAn infusion of new talent is poised for action, led by forward Smith and center back Naomi Girma, who were teammates at Stanford and shined bright in last year’s NWSL season. Smith, who won the 2022 championship with the Portland Thorns, was named league MVP, while Girma won both Rookie and Defender of the Year awards. Other young stars to keep an eye on are 18-year-old Alyssa Thompson, who replaced Mal Swanson in the second April friendly, and 20-year-old Trinity Rodman, who was a Ballon d’Or finalist this year.\n\nCatarina Macario, 23, is still a TBD as she recovers from a torn ACL. Macario was expected to resume playing for Lyon (France) in March, but that return was delayed and the club reportedly is still not clear on her timing. She was left off the U.S. roster for this month’s friendlies, which Andonovski addressed last week: “First, we need to see performance,” he said regarding her chances of making the final roster. “We have to see her on the field… Cat has to get back in a professional environment, play professional games, competitive games, games that matter.”\n\nOther notable names on the questionable list include Abby Dahlkemper (back), Tobin Heath (knee surgery) and Christen Press (torn ACL), who revealed in March that she’s had three surgeries in the last eight months on her knee. Andonovski previously confirmed Sam Mewis as likely unavailable after undergoing a second knee surgery.\n\nUSWNT on course to face England in 2023 Women’s World Cup final\n\nThe draw for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup was announced in October, with the U.S. women and their perennial foe England on opposite sides of the bracket. The U.S. is aiming to become the first team in either the women’s or men’s game to win three successive World Cups, after taking the title in 2015 and 2019. But they face a battle in their Group E pairings, which include Vietnam, Portugal and Netherlands, whom they beat in the final in Lyon, France, four years ago.\n\nThe USWNT World Cup group schedule (all times ET):\n\nFriday, July 21: USA vs. Vietnam, 9 p.m. ET at Eden Park (Auckland, N.Z.)\n\nUSA vs. Vietnam, 9 p.m. ET at Eden Park (Auckland, N.Z.) Wednesday, July 26: USA vs. Netherlands, 9 p.m. at Wellington Regional Stadium (Wellington, N.Z.)\n\nUSA vs. Netherlands, 9 p.m. at Wellington Regional Stadium (Wellington, N.Z.) Tuesday, Aug. 1: USA vs. Portugal, 3 a.m. at Eden Park\n\nThe USWNT secured its spot in the tournament last July at the 2022 Concacaf W Championship, where it clinched the title with a 1-0 victory over 2020 Olympic gold medalist Canada and also punched its ticket to the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nThey closed out the 2022 calendar year with a 14-3-1 record, with all three losses coming in the later months of the year. The rare losing streak started with a 2-1 loss to England at iconic Wembley Stadium on Oct. 7, followed by a 2-0 loss to Spain on Oct. 11 and a 2-1 defeat by Germany on Nov. 10. They wrapped 2022 on a high note, beating Germany 2-1 on Nov. 13.\n\nThe #FIFAWWC 2023 Groups are set! 🙌 Which one is the most exciting? 😁 #BeyondGreatness — FIFA Women's World Cup (@FIFAWWC) February 23, 2023\n\nA total of 32 nations will compete in the Women’s World Cup for the first time, up from 24 in 2015 and 2019. The event began as a 12-team tournament in 1991 and was expanded to include 16 countries in 1999. The number was increased to 24 teams ahead of the 2015 edition in Canada.\n\nThe field was finalized in February at the conclusion of a 10-team playoff tournament, where Haiti, Panama and Portugal qualified for the 2023 Women’s World Cup. The groups are:\n\nGroup A: New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Switzerland\n\nNew Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Switzerland Group B: Australia, Republic of Ireland, Nigeria, Canada\n\nAustralia, Republic of Ireland, Nigeria, Canada Group C: Spain, Costa Rica, Zambia, Japan\n\nSpain, Costa Rica, Zambia, Japan Group D: England, Haiti (Group B playoff winner), Denmark, China\n\nEngland, Haiti (Group B playoff winner), Denmark, China Group E: United States, Vietnam, Netherlands, Portugal (Group A playoff winner)\n\nUnited States, Vietnam, Netherlands, Portugal (Group A playoff winner) Group F: France, Jamaica, Brazil, Panama (Group C playoff winner)\n\nFrance, Jamaica, Brazil, Panama (Group C playoff winner) Group G: Sweden, South Africa, Italy, Argentina\n\nSweden, South Africa, Italy, Argentina Group H: Germany, Morocco, Colombia, South Korea\n\nWhat’s the format for the 2023 Women’s World Cup?\n\nThe 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four nations. Each team will play every team in their group once, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the knockout rounds.\n\nThe competition then moves on to a Round of 16 (Aug. 5-8), followed by the quarterfinals (Aug. 11-12) and semifinals (Aug. 15-16). The match to determine third place will be Friday, Aug. 19, with the final set for Saturday, Aug. 20. The tournament is being held across nine cities in Australia and New Zealand, with the final to be staged at the 83,500-seat Stadium Australia in Sydney.\n\nPortugal, Haiti, Panama earn final three spots in 2023 Women’s World Cup\n\nThe competition to decide the final three final entrants to the 2023 Women’s World Cup was held Feb. 18-23, with 10 teams from six confederations participating in the play-in tournament. Portugal, Haiti and Panama won their respective groups to secure their spots, and World Cup co-host New Zealand hosted the contests at two of the World Cup venues, Waikato Stadium in Hamilton and North Harbour Stadium in Auckland.\n\nTen teams that narrowly missed out on qualification via their confederations’ qualifying tournaments made up the intercontinental playoff field:\n\nAFC (Asia): Chinese Taipei, Thailand\n\nChinese Taipei, Thailand CAF (Africa): Cameroon, Senegal\n\nCameroon, Senegal Concacaf (North America): Haiti, Panama\n\nHaiti, Panama Conmebol (South America): Chile, Paraguay\n\nChile, Paraguay OFC (Oceania): Papua New Guinea\n\nPapua New Guinea UEFA (Europe): Portugal\n\nThe 10-team field was then divided into two groups of three teams and one group of four teams. The winners of each group secured their spots in the 2023 World Cup (bold denotes winner):\n\nGroup A: Portugal (top seed), Cameroon, Thailand\n\n(top seed), Cameroon, Thailand Group B: Chile (top seed), Senegal, Haiti\n\nChile (top seed), Senegal, Group C: Chinese Taipei, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Panama\n\nThe top two seeds, Portugal and Chile, were given the top spots in Groups 1 and 2, respectively, and received first-round byes. The top seed in each group faced the winner of the first-round match between the two unseeded teams in the group final. Hence, Cameroon beat Thailand for the right to play Portugal in the Group A final, while Haiti blanked Senegal before beating Chile in Group B. In Group C, the third-seeded Chinese Taipei fell to unseeded Paraguay, while fourth-seeded Papua New Guinea lost to unseeded Panama. Panama bested Paraguay 1-0 to win Group C.\n\nALSO FROM ON HER TURF: USWNT takes 1-0 edge over Ireland into last friendly ahead of Women’s World Cup",

                    "snippet": "The road to the U.S. Open began this week for thousands of players, with an 18-hole local qualifier in the Houston area on Monday and another in North Carolina on Wednesday.\n\nA dozen or so players from LIV Golf already decided to pass by not entering.\n\nThat includes Louis Oosthuizen, a runner-up at Torrey Pines in 2021 and at Chambers Bay in 2015. By not filing a U.S. Open entry, his only other avenue to Los Angeles Country Club is to win the PGA Championship next month. He currently is not in the PGA field, and at No. 136 in the world, is not likely to get an invitation.\n\nOthers who chose not to enter and who are well outside the top 100 in the world are Bubba Watson, Paul Casey, Charles Howell III, Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Charl Schwartzel.\n\nPatrick Reed also did not file an entry, though he could be safe. The U.S. Open exempts anyone from the top 60 in the world ranking on May 22, the Monday after the PGA Championship. Reed’s tie for fourth at the Masters has him at No. 44 this week, and it looks as though he will stay in the top 60.\n\nThe U.S. Open is June 15-18.\n\nPHOTOS: Road to US Open begins, some LIV Golf players take a pass\n\nTalor Gooch is at No. 57 this week and did not file an entry. Without access to world ranking points, he would need a big finish in the PGA Championship to have a chance. That starts with getting into the PGA Championship, and special invitations have not been announced.\n\nKerry Haigh, the chief championships officer for the PGA, has said he “absolutely” would consider LIV Golf players in trying to put together the best field for Oak Hill on May 18-21.\n\nAmong the players from Saudi-funded LIV Golf who entered are Sergio Garcia, Matthew Wolff, Marc Leishman and Harold Varner III.\n\nGarcia has signed up for the first 36-hole sectional qualifier in Dallas on May 22, the Monday before Colonial. The former Masters champion has played in every U.S. Open starting with Pebble Beach in 2000. The last time he had to go through qualifying was in 2011, when he advanced in a 7-for-4 playoff.\n\nThe R&A takes the top 50 from the May 22 ranking for the British Open. The deadline for entering is not until June 1.\n\nThe USGA accepted a record 10,187 entries, breaking the previous mark of 10,127 accepted in 2014 when the U.S. Open was held at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nThe USGA said 52 players are exempt from qualifying - Ryan Fox and Tommy Fleetwood also are locked in but not yet announced - from the European tour points list last year. It would appear to be on target for its goal of having roughly half of the 156-man field come from 36-hole qualifying.\n\nSPECIAL TEMPORARY MEMBERS\n\nRyan Gerard and Nicolai Hojgaard of Denmark are the latest players to accept special temporary membership on the PGA Tour, and there’s never been a better time for that.\n\nGerard and Hojgaard - along with Akshay Bhatia, who reached that status a month ago - can take unlimited sponsor exemptions the remainder of the season. They can get full PGA Tour cards if their FedEx Cup points are equivalent to No. 125 at the end of the season. They typically would have only about three months remaining before the regular season ends.\n\nBut the tour is moving to a calendar season starting in 2024. That means that while temporary members are not eligible for the postseason (unless they win), they now will have as many as seven tournaments in the fall to keep playing. The top 125 in the FedEx Cup is not decided until November after the RSM Classic.\n\nGerard began his run as a Monday qualifier for the Honda Classic. He finished fourth, which got him into Puerto Rico, where he tied for 11th. Hojgaard received an exemption to the Dominican Republic event and was runner-up.\n\nGRANT STATUS\n\nLinn Grant has emerged as Sweden’s best player, a four-time winner on the Ladies European Tour last year along with two runner-up finishes.\n\nBut she won’t be at The Chevron Championship this week in Houston to start the LPGA major season. And she has been replaced in the International Crown scheduled for Harding Park in San Francisco in two weeks.\n\nGolfweek reported the 23-year-old Grant is not vaccinated against COVID-19, and the U.S. requires international visitors to be fully vaccinated.\n\nGrant, who played at Arizona State, is No. 23 in the women’s world ranking.\n\nThe International Crown on May 4-7 features eight countries each with four players. She was to compete alongside Maja Stark (No. 27), Madelene Sagstrom (No. 28) and Anna Nordqvist (No. 34). Instead, Grant has been replaced by the next highest-rank Swede, Caroline Hedwall, at No. 119.\n\nGrant hopes the U.S. policy will have eased in time for her to play the LPGA Match Play on May 24-28 at Shadow Creek north of Las Vegas.\n\nSENIOR CUP\n\nThe PGA Tour Champions has sanctioned a tournament that combines the Ryder Cup and the Presidents Cup into one competition during the silly season.\n\nThe World Champions Cup will be Dec. 7-10 at The Concession in Bradenton, Florida. It features six-man teams of PGA Tour Champions members competing for Team USA, Team Europe and Team International.\n\nJim Furyk (U.S.), Ernie Els (International) and Darren Clarke (Europe) will be captains. Each has been a captain in the Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup.\n\nThe nine-hole matches will include formats and singles play, and points will be earned for each hole won in each of the 24 matches played over three days. Teams will determined by the top two from a points lists, two chairman’s picks and the other two spots based on the Charles Schwab Cup standings. Peter Jacobsen will be the event chairman.\n\nThe event is being run by Intersport and will be televised by ESPN and ABC. Competition days are Thursday, Friday and Sunday, with a pro-am set for Saturday.\n\nIt will be held the same weekend as the mixed team Grant Thornton Championship about two hours to the south in Naples.\n\nDIVOTS\n\nCBS said Sunday coverage of the RBC Heritage averaged 4.15 million viewers, up 13% from last year. It was the most-watched final round at Hilton Head in 21 years. … Lee Smith is the new executive director of The Players Championship. He previously was the general manager at Liberty National Golf Club in New Jersey. Smith takes over for Jared Rice, who will lead business development for the PGA Tour‘s championship management division. … According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Jon Rahm has had 28 rounds in the 60s at the majors dating to 2019, the most of any player. … Lexi Thompson will play a home tournament on the Ladies European Tour.

Seeking to head off a new fight with some of the world’s top women’s players at their own championship, Infantino promised a solution would be in place before the Women’s World Cup opens in Australia and New Zealand on July 20.\n\nYet even as he was offering those assurances, FIFA had already found a new way of angering both its players and its partners.",

                    "snippet": "• The draft may ignite the running back trade market: Dalvin Cook, Derrick Henry and Austin Ekeler have all been rumored to be on the trade block, and one or more could be on the move sooner rather than later.\n\n• Does DeAndre Hopkins find a new team during the draft? Similar to how the Titans dealt A.J. Brown last year, Arizona may look to trade Hopkins during the draft.\n\nEstimated Reading Time: 5 mins\n\nThe NFL draft promises excitement coupled with shock and awe year in and year out, but not just in the form of surprise draft picks and blockbuster draft pick trades. Who can forget during the 2022 NFL Draft when wide receiver A.J. Brown was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles, or when Marquise Brown was traded to the Arizona Cardinals?\n\nWe saw tackle Trent Williams moved to the San Francisco 49ers in 2020, among other hugely impactful trades in prior years, and 2023 should be no different. With the draft now fewer than 10 days away, we'll look at 10 veterans who could potentially be on the move during next weekend’s festivities.\n\nLet's kick things off with five offensive players, before sharing our defensive candidates later this week.\n\nNFL Media’s Ian Rapoport mentioned on “The Pat McAfee Show” that he believes Hopkins may ultimately be traded before the draft kicks off, but if not, he’s the top name to monitor throughout the weekend.\n\nHopkins tweeted and then deleted that he was not looking for a new contract. If true, Arizona should be able to get a decent return here — maybe a third-round pick — especially if they are willing to retain some of Hopkins’ $19.45 million 2023 salary.\n\nHopkins has missed time the past few seasons due to injuries and a suspension but is still one of the more reliable receivers across the NFL. Over the past three seasons, Hopkins' 88.6 receiving grade ranks 10th among wide receivers, his 1.7% drop rate is the third-lowest mark and he's still top 15 in yards per route run. From Weeks 7-16 in 2022 when he did play, Hopkins ranked third in targets (93) and fourth in receptions (64) among wide receivers.\n\nAfter the Bengals signed Orlando Brown Jr. to be their left tackle, Williams promptly put in a trade request. There’s still a possibility that cooler heads prevail here if Cincinnati can convince Williams that a move to right tackle is not as bad as it seems. Williams started for a year at right tackle at Alabama before sliding over, and if his resistance to moving back over is not due to a lack of comfort but is more contract-related, there’s a reasonable discussion to be had.\n\nLeft tackle is still viewed as the more important and valuable position — just ask Brown — but the gap between the two position markets has shrunk considerably in recent years. It would not be unfairly manipulative to sell Williams on the idea that he could cash out on a bigger deal after a stellar season at right tackle in Cincinnati than after forcing his way to a new team and continuing to play on the left side.\n\nIf not, Williams carries a $12.604 million fully guaranteed fifth-year option with him to a new club. The good news for Williams is this year’s tackle class is not viewed as particularly strong at the top.\n\nThere were rumors swirling that Henry could be traded at the beginning of the 2023 league year, with the Titans moving on from a handful of highly paid veterans and resetting their books. Henry is still playing at an elite level, but the bulldozing back will be 29 years old in 2023 and the Titans may prefer some further monetary savings in a year during which not many expect them to compete for a Super Bowl. Over the past three seasons, Henry’s 92.4 rushing grade leads the NFL and his 3,475 rushing yards after contact are over 500 more than the next-highest running back.\n\nNew general manager Ran Carthon was also an NFL running back, so perhaps he would help Henry land somewhere he could contend for a championship out of respect. However, the former second-rounder may also want to retire with the team that drafted him in 2016.\n\nHenry has a $10.5 million salary in the final year of his contract, with the expiring deal part of the complication here. Is a team willing to trade away draft picks and extend Henry, otherwise running the risk he’s there for only one season?\n\nCook’s situation is similar to Henry’s, though he has three years remaining on his contract. That said, non-guaranteed salaries in later years for Cook could functionally be somewhat similar to Henry’s void years beyond 2023 in that a team may utilize them for salary cap savings but not actually want to pay them out.\n\nCook’s 112 explosive rushes and 3,900 rushing yards over the past three seasons are both the second most in the NFL, and his 9.0 yards after the catch per reception ranks fourth among running backs with at least 75 targets over the span. Amid all the positives, Cook’s 65.8 overall grade in 2021 and 67.4 overall grade in 2022 are the lowest of his career, and Minnesota appears to be in a staredown with him over potentially taking a pay cut before the 2023 season gets underway.\n\nEkeler was granted permission to seek a trade after extension discussions reportedly broke down between his camp and the Chargers, with Ekeler set to earn just $6.25 million in the final year of his four-year, $24.5 million extension signed in 2020 that has proven to be very team-friendly.\n\nEkeler’s 323 receptions over the past four seasons are 55 more than any other running back, ranking 12th among all players over the span. His 23 receiving touchdowns over the span are seven clear of the next-highest back, and his 29 rushing touchdowns are tied for ninth. Ekeler uses his short-area quickness and low center of gravity to win on key downs and in the red zone, and he’ll be 28 years old through the 2023 season. While he’ll never be a true workhorse back, that’s arguably a good thing to keep him a bit fresher with less wear and tear.",

                    "snippet": "There are under 100 days to go until the women's World Cup kicks off in Australia and New Zealand. Read more\n\nThose relatively new to soccer might imagine that given the women’s World Cup’s popularity, every game of a tournament has long been televised in English and Spanish. That’s been the case with the men’s World Cup for decades, and it’s been a dozen years since the U.S. women relaunched themselves into the spotlight with a dramatic run to the 2011 final.\n\nIn fact, a fully televised women’s World Cup broadcast in the two most popular languages of the United States has never been the case until now. Though English-language women’s World Cup broadcasters have televised every game since 2007, this year’s tournament will be the first one in which every game is on traditional TV in Spanish.\n\nTelemundo, owned by Philadelphia-based Comcast, isn’t just making the move because of the U.S. team’s popularity, or because many games in Australia and New Zealand are at odd times here. It’s doing so because the sport as a whole is growing across the Americas.\n\nThe expansion of the World Cup this year to 32 teams means more teams from Spanish-speaking nations in North, Central and South America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, debutant Panama, and a U.S. squad that’s the most diverse it’s ever been.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe American team this summer could have two players of Mexican descent (Sofia Huerta and Ashley Sanchez); one each with roots in Brazil (Catarina Macario) and Peru (Alyssa Thompson, also of Filipino descent); and a record number of Black players (at least six and likely more, if they’re all healthy), including one of Ethiopian descent (Naomi Girma).\n\n» READ MORE: Mallory Swanson’s injury is a reminder that the USWNT’s depth is its biggest asset\n\n“I think just as much as the U.S. men’s national team, the U.S. women’s national team represents our society as a whole, not just from the Hispanic perspective,” Telemundo’s famed lead play-by-play voice Andrés Cantor said. “It’s a very well-blended group of very talented players. The young generation, it’s very interesting to watch and to see how they will evolve, and we’re looking forward to seeing [if] that mix of the old guard plus the young, upcoming stars can help them for the three-peat.”\n\nTelemundo plans to put 33 of the tournament’s 64 games on its flagship broadcast network and 31 on cable channel Universo. The total for Telemundo is the most on an over-the-air broadcast network in women’s World Cup history, regardless of language, though Fox hasn’t announced its plans yet. But 33 is a bigger number than Fox’s 16 in 2015 and 22 in 2019.\n\n“The audience for women’s football is growing significantly — we’ve seen that with some of our executions already with Team USA on our platforms, our support of [Mexico’s] Chivas Femenil as well on the Liga MX side, and other executions that we’ve done in the past,” Telemundo’s executive vice president of sports Eli Velazquez said.\n\n“We saw a good reaction to our coverage of 2019 [in] France,” he continued. “And we’ve noticed that over the course of [the] last four years, there has been significant investment and significant development in Latin America, for the national teams and league teams that feature women’s football … We’re bullish on how big it has gotten, and how big it will get.”\n\n» READ MORE: A look back at how Telemundo covered the 2019 women’s World Cup\n\nThere will also be live streaming of every game on Peacock, following Telemundo’s success doing so with the men’s World Cup in Qatar last fall. That will give cord-cutters another way to watch games.\n\nCantor will be Telemundo’s lead play-by-play voice, as he has long been. The lead analyst will be Manuel Sol, Cantor’s longtime broadcast partner for soccer of all kinds — including U.S. women’s team friendlies that Telemundo bought the rights to this year.\n\nCantor and Sol won’t call every U.S. game, though. Velasquez said the plan is for them to call some U.S. games, but also have some latitude to go to other big games in the tournament.\n\nThat will mean a lot of travel. It’s a four-hour flight east across the Tasman Sea from Sydney, Australia to Auckland, New Zealand; and a five-hour flight west from Sydney to Perth, nearly the full length of Australia.\n\n“The approach is focus on the Team USA path, and then let’s take a look at all of the other meaningful matches that surround that,” Velazquez said. “And then logistically, let’s see where we can send them.”\n\n» READ MORE: A look back at how Telemundo covered the 2015 women’s World Cup\n\nIt may run up a big bill for Comcast, but Velasquez is happy to pay it. And this time, he won’t just be doing so for Cantor and Sol. The network’s studio hosts will be traveling a lot too — and really, they won’t be “studio” hosts. Telemundo won’t have one central studio the way Fox is expected to. Instead, the four hosts — Ana Jurka, Miguel Gurwitz, Carlota Vizmanos and Carlos Yustis — will work from the sites of big games.\n\nJurka hosted coverage in 2019 from Paris and Lyon. She said she asked Cantor for tips on how he’s done it for all these years.\n\n“He goes, ‘Well, you can’t bring four suitcases — you have to bring just one carry-on and a backpack,’” Jurka said. “It’s going to be a different challenge, and for us as hosts it’s going to be exciting. Because we always are in the same place.”\n\nOther game broadcasters named so far include play-by-play announcers Copán Álvarez, Jorge Calvo, Daniella Lopez-Guajaro (coming over from Fox) and Sammy Sadovnik, and analysts Eduardo Biscayart and Natalia Astrain — the coach of the U.S. under-17 women’s team who won widespread acclaim for her work on Telemundo’s coverage in Qatar.

                    "snippet": "Marc Skinner has labelled Manchester United and Chelsea’s 8,000-ticket allocations for the Women’s FA Cup final as “crazy”, as supporters seek to buy tickets after the two teams' respective semi-final victories last weekend.\n\nLast season’s men’s FA Cup final saw Chelsea and Liverpool assigned 30,500 tickets each, by comparison, ensuring fans of the specific finalists made up at least two thirds of the stadium, whereas fewer than 20 per cent of the Wembley capacity has been designated for Manchester United and Chelsea's women's fans for May 14's showpiece event.\n\n\n\nThe men's final has regularly been a sell-out, though, whereas the women’s final has seen attendances at the national stadium ranging from 40,000 to 49,000 over the past four years. However, the Football Association announced on Monday that 65,000 tickets had been issued for this year's women’s final already with a neutral area of 50,000 seats now sold out. Sales for the ends assigned to each club now follow and it is thought Wembley may well be filled for this event for the first time.\n\nUnited, the Women’s Super League leaders, confirmed they had been given an initial allocation of 8,000 for the east side of the stadium, while Chelsea said their allocation for the west side was 7,530. United manager Skinner was asked at a press conference on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday’s WSL match against Arsenal – at which around 10,000 fans are expected to attend Leigh Sports Village – about some upset among fans regarding the allocations for the final.\n\n\n\n“In all honesty, I absolutely share that sentiment, absolutely,” Skinner said. “I don’t know how many it is in the men’s game, I really don’t, I don’t know how many they allocate. But to give clubs like Chelsea and Manchester United 8,000 tickets to sell, it’s crazy in my opinion, crazy. To give two massive clubs 8,000 tickets is just crazy.”\n\n\n\nThe FA has been approached for comment.\n\nManchester United are appearing in the final for the first time in their history, while holders Chelsea have reached Wembley for a third year in a row.\n\n\n\nThe fixture is poised to feature a record for the Women’s FA Cup final attendance, with the biggest crowd to date being the 49,094 that were at Wembley for last season’s contest, when Chelsea sealed a 3-2 extra-time victory over Manchester City.\n\nThe sides are also vying for the WSL title, with leaders United a point clear of second-placed defending champions Chelsea having played a game more. Arsenal are a further two points back in third.\n\n\n\nArsenal travel to Leigh Sports Village to face Manchester United on Wednesday with their title destiny still technically in the north Londoners’ hands, although neither side can really afford to drop points. Chelsea, who – like Arsenal – have a game in hand, know they would also be champions if they win all of their remaining WSL games.",

                    "snippet": "There has been tangible growth on social media in the past three years, too, with #MyPLMorning usually trending locally on Saturdays during the season. With football already gaining ground on NFL, NBA and MLB, organisers of the 2026 World Cup across the US, Mexico and Canada say the Premier League bubble is nowhere near bursting.\n\n'It's truly part of the culture here in the US now'\n\nChris Canetti, president of Houston's successful 2026 World Cup bid to be a host city, says England's top tier is now \"embedded in a way I've never known before\".\n\nAs a college student in the early 1990s, he did not watch a single minute of live action during the last time his nation hosted the tournament. Now, he explains, most students would recognise Premier League players. \"While MLS teams continue to grow and continue to build fan bases, it's just so obvious to see how the English league is becoming a big deal here as well,\" he says. \"You run into Americans all the time now, who are either Arsenal, Manchester United or even West Ham. It's truly part of the culture here in the US now.\"\n\n‘We were late to the party – but now we’re catching up’\n\nThe buzz around the domestic game is not just confined to the Premier League, of course. Steve Horowitz, the co-founder of New York-based Inner Circle Sports, was a key figure in the sale of Wrexham to Hollywood's Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds in 2021.\n\n\"What I say in a lot of my meetings is, 'The rest of the world isn't wrong',\" the footballing dealmaker explains. \"Football is the game of the world, as we are reminded each year when the World Cup is played, and the EPL is by far the most-followed league. The NFL may be the biggest game in America but relatively few people in Asia, Africa or South America know who the Dallas Cowboys are. They all know who Man Utd and Liverpool are.\n\n'I don't see how it doesn't continue to flourish'\n\n\"I think America is just catching up. You hear talk of American sports trying to shorten their games to keep the attention of the younger fans. There is such elegance about knowing a match is going to start at three and you can set your watch and you will be on your way home by five. And the games themselves are so great. The culture of it, the singing, the passion, and the tribalism. We were just late to the party – but we're here now.\"\n\nElsewhere in club investment circles, there have been suggestions in recent weeks that interest in the US is not as fierce for United this spring as it was for Chelsea this time last year. But optimistic sentiments from Horowitz, Canetti and 63-year-old Scudamore, a regular visitor to the US since first flying out to visit family aged 10, will leave the Glazers confident ahead of a April 28 bid deadline. \"I don't see how it really doesn't continue to flourish,\" Scudamore concludes. Those promises in the Manhattan boardroom a decade ago have been kept.",

Sometimes they go into teams that are flying and they get put in, they find their feet and you see them fly.\n\n\"So maybe there are reasons with some of our players where there is a bit of transition. But in terms of motivation, you are playing for Chelsea. There are individual motivations all throughout the squad and as a collective and we have to be competitive in everything we do every day.\"\n\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard shares a moment with Thiago Silva after their loss to Real Madrid.

I picked a team today which was the most form team individually, the fittest team in terms of what this game was going to ask of us. And they showed it, they showed they can compete with Real Madrid for sure other than the final third stuff [finishing chances].\n\n\"It is important to take each step. The next step now for the players is day off tomorrow, back to work Thursday. Get working towards Brentford, because people will make a lot about this season for Chelsea because they've had so much success.\n\n\"The reality is this club is going to be back. It'll take work. It'll take maybe a bit of process. I think the fans appreciated the performance today and maybe this season they have had moments where they haven't felt like that.\n\n\"We have to latch onto that, get results until the end of the season and then go again next year.\"",

                    "snippet": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Chelsea's American owners saw their last hope of any glory in their first season crumble on Tuesday when the club they bought in a deal worth 4.25 billion pounds ($5.28 billion) last year were knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid.\n\nMarooned in the unfamiliar bottom half of the Premier League, Chelsea are at risk of their worst domestic league finish in nearly 30 years and they also fell at the first hurdle in the FA Cup and League Cup.\n\nTheir only chance of qualifying for next season's lucrative Champions League by winning the competition has also now evaporated after Real's 4-0 aggregate quarter-final win following a 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe prospect of a drop in income is raising fears among Chelsea fans that some of the club's best young players will be sold to meet financial rules.\n\nThe spectacular slump in the 2022/23 season - during which Chelsea have had three different coaches - stands in contrast with the string of heady campaigns under previous owner, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.\n\nHe was forced to sell the club by Britain's government last year following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.\n\nChelsea were the most successful team in England in the period between Abramovich buying the club in 2003 and its sale in 2022, a run that included two Champions League triumphs in 2012 and 2021 and five English league titles.\n\nThat track record - and the surge in global support for the west London club along the way - explained Chelsea's appeal to a consortium led by LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly and backed by Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm.\n\nBIG SPENDERS, LOW SCORERS\n\nOn top of the deal to buy the club last May, they have invested a further 550 million pounds on players, spending in the January transfer window more than all the clubs in the top divisions of Spain, Italy, Germany and France combined.\n\nBut somehow they failed to buy someone capable of scoring goals on a regular basis with a gamble on former Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang failing at almost the first test.\n\nChelsea have scored 30 goals in 31 league games so far. By contrast, table-topping Arsenal have scored 74 and second-placed Manchester City have found the net 78 times.\n\nTuesday's blank was the fifth in six games in all competitions.\n\nWith no spearhead for their attack, Chelsea's managers this season - Thomas Tuchel, Graham Potter and now caretaker boss Frank Lampard - have all struggled to turn a collection of expensive stars and home-grown talent into a cohesive team.\n\nChelsea fans have turned their frustrations on the owners of the club and some were photographed remonstrating with Boehly in his executive box after last weekend's 2-1 home defeat by Brighton & Hove Albion. British media said an upset Boehly talked to players in the dressing room after that result.\n\nNow he and his fellow owners - none of whom had experience of running a major soccer club before they bought Chelsea - face the huge decision of who to hire as the club's next coach.\n\nCandidates include former Bayern Munich manager Julian Nagelsmann and Luis Enrique, who coached Spain at the World Cup in Qatar. Such a high-profile manager would represent a big change in approach after the hiring of Potter from modest Brighton last September.\n\nRegardless of who takes over, a return to Europe's biggest stage seemed a distant prospect for the disappointed Chelsea fans streaming out of Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night.\n\n($1 = 0.8045 pounds)\n\nWriting by William Schomberg; Editing by Ken Ferris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                    "snippet": "Jennifer Pottheiser/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver provided some details on the in-season tournament that will be implemented during the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nWhen speaking at Tuesday's Sports Business Journal's World Congress of Sports he told reporters, \"The players will be wearing different uniforms. Maybe the court will look different. You'll know that it's not just a regular-season game.\"\n\nHe also said there will be an initial round, a knockout round and pool play ahead of four semifinalists who will play at a neutral site.\n\nUltimately, Silver explained the idea is \"to create new games of consequences during the regular season\" and pointed to international soccer as something of a blueprint.\n\n\"Taking a page from European soccer where they play for multiple cups throughout the season,\" he said. \"We think taking nothing away from the Larry O'Brien trophy, and the ultimate goal of winning a championship, that you can create another competition within the season that becomes meaningful. And there's a recognition that new traditions are not built overnight.\"\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski and Bobby Marks reported each player on the winning team will receive $500,000 with $200,000 going to the players on the runner-ups. The financial incentive was notable because it is easy to wonder whether the motivation level for players will be any different than a normal regular season game even if it will \"look different.\"\n\nSilver addressed that notion as well.\n\n\"And I think that particularly it was interesting when we first started talking to our players about it several years ago,\" he said. \"Part of the initial reaction from players is 'Why would we care?' It's interesting with getting close to a third of our players now who were born outside the United States, they're very familiar with this Cup notion from European soccer or soccer tournaments elsewhere in the world.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Ben Rohrbach of Yahoo Sports reported on the format of the tournament.\n\nTeams will be placed in intraconference pools for group games, and winners and wild-card teams will advance to the single-elimination part of the tournament. The only game that won't count on the regular-season record for teams is the championship contest, and the financial incentive will come into play at that point.\n\nFrankly, fans likely won't notice much of a difference at first.\n\nThe race for the NBA title will still be the most important thing even if the in-season tournament championship game in particular adds an element of intrigue that wouldn't necessarily be there for a normal regular-season contest.\n\nIt could also lead to some additional inter-conference matchups depending on how the bracket unfolded.\n\nBut this won't be a significant change for the overall fan experience with all but one game impacting the regular-season standings and just one additional contest for the two finalists on the entire league schedule.",

Chicago's DeMar DeRozan and Miami's Jimmy Butler were the other finalists.\n\nDe'Aaron Fox won the NBA's first-ever Clutch Player of the Year award for the 2022-23 season\n\nFox led the NBA with a total of 194 points in clutch situations down the stretch of games\n\nDeRozan was second in the NBA with 159 clutch points this season, and Butler was third with 151.\n\nFox led the league in clutch-game scoring this season with 194 points in 39 such games; clutch games are defined as those where the margin between teams is five points or less at any point in the final 5:00. He actually shot better from the field in those moments (53 percent) than he did at all other times (51 percent).\n\nHe becomes the first recipient of The Jerry West Award; it was named for the player who earned the moniker of 'Mr. Clutch' during his career.\n\nThe NBA announced in December that it was adding the clutch award; like most other awards, it is voted on by the media panel, but unlike other awards the field of candidates is first narrowed down by polling of NBA coaches.\n\nFox was one of many major contributors to a resurgence in Sacramento this season.\n\nThe Kings - who currently lead defending champion Golden State 2-0 in a Western Conference first-round series - reached the postseason for the first time in 17 years.\n\nFox is averaging a team-best 31 points in those two playoff games so far. And at 48-34, this was Sacramento's best regular season since going 50-32 in 2004-05.\n\nThe award was the second major individual one to be announced by the league this season.\n\nFox (left) looks to pass the ball after driving past Denver Nuggets center DeAndre Jordan\n\nMemphis' Jaren Jackson Jr. was announced Monday as the defensive player of the year.\n\nCoach of the year - Brown, Oklahoma City's Mark Daigneault or Boston's Joe Mazzulla - will be announced Wednesday and Sixth Man of the Year - Boston's Malcolm Brogdon, Milwaukee's Bobby Portis Jr. or New York's Immanuel Quickley - will be revealed Thursday.\n\nThe rest of the schedule for announcing other league awards, including MVP, most improved player and Rookie of the Year, has not yet been disclosed.",

                    "snippet": "I’m here to extend an olive branch: Bijan Robinson is absolutely worth a first-round draft pick — and potentially quite a high one.\n\nPFF is anti-running back. Analytics as a whole has been at the forefront of the push to devalue the position in the NFL and hasn't often made that case in tremendously subtle terms. “Running backs don’t matter” became a slogan, and teams have been lambasted for drafting a running back in the second round with their fourth selection. This was an overcorrection.\n\nPFF is not a monolith, so I’m not speaking for everybody who works here, but I think some of the discussion surrounding running back value went too far.\n\nEveryone likes to talk in absolutes, but the various factors at work make the decision far too complicated for that. To me, the debate about a running back essentially comes down to three questions at any draft spot:\n\n1. What will his contract look like at this pick number?\n\n2. What is the opportunity cost? Who are we leaving on the board?\n\n3. Do I need this player to fix a misfiring run game or add value to one that’s already functional?\n\nThe third question is the easiest one to address: If your running game is non-functional, do not draft a running back in the first round to fix it because he probably won’t.\n\nAll the things we learned about the dependency of the position remain true. And so a running back — almost no matter how good he is — will not overcome a bad situation and fix the run game by himself. He needs a viable offensive line. He needs a functional passing game. He probably needs an offense that will threaten defenses in ways to take defenders out of the box. So, if my team already has a good offensive line and a viable offense overall, we can talk.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers had the worst rushing offense in the NFL in 2020, gaining 1,351 yards on the ground at a miserable 3.6 yards per carry. They drafted all 232 pounds of Najee Harris in the first round to fix that and improved to 3.8 yards per carry the following season because they didn’t address the root cause of the problem — the blocking.\n\nThe Contract\n\nIn a world of salary cap and roster limits, contracts are everything. Rookie contracts are now aligned to draft position and so potentially provide incredible value relative to veteran alternatives.\n\nThe true value of the contract differs depending on position. For example, the No. 5 overall pick will receive a contract worth around $34 million over four years (with a fifth-year option). That contract would make a running back the league's highest-paid player at the position in terms of average per year (APY), but it would be just 18th for a wide receiver and 16th for an offensive tackle.\n\nBijan Robinson could be the best running back in the NFL the second he steps foot on a professional field. But if he’s drafted in the top five, the team that drafts him will have to pay him as if he is, so they will get nothing in terms of surplus value. If he isn’t the best running back in the NFL, they will still be paying him as if he is.\n\nIf a team drafts him at No. 10 overall, that contract would make him around the 16th-best-paid back in the league, so there’s a much easier case to be made for surplus value. And, obviously, the later he is drafted, the better the case is from a financial point of view.\n\nThe flip side is that the position has become devalued largely because of a surplus of talent. Good backs are available in the NFL and later in the draft for a relatively inexpensive sum, but in Robinson, we are focusing specifically on a player with special credentials as a prospect.\n\nTo me, you can make a financial case to draft Robinson anywhere after Pick No. 7.\n\nThe Opportunity Cost\n\nThe final decision to be made is whether drafting a back is worth the opportunity cost of passing up a player at a more valuable position. This is the most complicated question to answer because the balance is between a higher grade and a more valuable position.\n\nFor years, teams have been lambasted for drafting for need — “reaching” for players instead of just drafting the best player available — but the other extreme is to take the highest-graded prospect on the board and come out of the draft having addressed the least valuable positions.\n\nThere is a necessary trade-off between how good a player is and how valuable the thing is that he is good at, and it’s one the NFL already recognizes — otherwise, kickers and punters would go in the first round all the time.\n\nRunning backs are less valuable than wide receivers, pass-rushers or cornerbacks, but at some point, the best running back prospect to enter the draft in years has a better average outcome than the fourth- or fifth-best player at one of the other positions. The problem is that identifying that sweet spot isn’t easy because it’s almost entirely based on the imprecise and nebulous idea of certainty and confidence in the projection and evaluation of each prospect.\n\nYou could certainly model the hit rate of running backs and other positions and make a rule of thumb based on those numbers, but Robinson falls into the category of an outlier — and that’s where we get into trouble.\n\nIn 2018, Quenton Nelson was so good as a prospect that it changed the rules. Guard is another position with relatively low value, and so you’ll hear a lot about how “you can’t draft a guard that early,” but the degree of certainty everybody had that not only would Nelson be good but that he would be elite changed the math.\n\nNelson went on to be the single most valuable offensive lineman in the league over his first three seasons, according to PFF Wins Above Replacement (PFF WAR). He was so good that it changed the norms of value by position in the NFL and consequently justified doing the same thing in the draft.\n\nThe equation when it comes to Bijan is similar and rests on that “special” status as a prospect. But the NFL is constantly talking itself into exceptions and typically making mistakes because of it. Given the uncertain nature of the draft and player evaluation, simply playing the percentages is likely the best way to go at all times, but exceptions are exceptions for a reason, and knowing the right moment to break the rules will pay off in a big way. Picking the wrong moment to do so, however, will simply bust.\n\nWhen it comes to this particular draft, it’s difficult to make a compelling case that Robinson should be drafted ahead of the top players at more valuable positions, but things get murkier quite quickly.\n\nWill Anderson Jr. should absolutely be drafted over Robinson as the top edge rusher available, but is the same true for Myles Murphy or Will McDonald IV? In a year nobody seems to love the top receiver prospects, should teams definitely draft Jordan Addison or Zay Flowers over Robinson? If either player hits the high end of their range of outcomes, they will be more valuable NFL players, but the certainty attached to that is significantly weaker.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTo this point, we have skated over the credentials that make Robinson such a quality prospect. He earned a 95.3 PFF grade last season, averaging 6.1 yards per attempt and over 4.1 yards after contact per attempt, and he broke 104 tackles to set a PFF single-season record. He has a smoothness of movement that can only remind you of the elite, Hall of Fame-caliber NFL running backs, and he has receiving chops, as well.\n\nHe is the complete package as a running back prospect, and using this three-pronged checklist, several teams will find value in selecting him in the first round.\n\nIn the late 20s, the value is a no-brainer. There are compelling cases to be made in the teens, but how early could he be selected without violating one of these conditions? Depending on how the board lands, Philadelphia at No. 10 overall could convince themselves that Robinson is so good that it is worth passing on the remaining talent to select him, particularly as the team has another pick later in the first round.\n\nThat’s probably the highest a team could justify drafting Robinson without sacrificing a more likely higher-impact move in selecting a lesser prospect at a more valuable position.",

                    "snippet": "How do NBA players really feel about the questions that fans debate all the time?\n\nWho would the players sign first if they had a chance to start a team from scratch? Which arena has the worst fans? Who is the coach, other than their own, they would most like to play for?\n\nWe know the players’ opinions now. We know because journalists from The Athletic spoke to 108 players, asked these questions (and more) and granted anonymity to allow players to speak their minds. During the final three weeks of the regular season, we polled nearly one-quarter of the league’s players — after practices, at morning shootarounds and before and after games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur beat writers, national writers, columnists and podcasters gathered responses for the project, and thanks to their efforts and help from many teams’ media-relations staffers, we surveyed players from all 30 NBA clubs.\n\nThe Athletic published its first leaguewide player poll in 2019, and readers told us they loved it. So why did we wait four long years to work on another poll? It wasn’t by choice. Blame the pandemic, which forced league officials to keep players beyond arm’s length from pretty much everyone else, including journalists and even many employees from their own teams. Those restrictions fully evaporated this season, giving us increased latitude to speak with players face-to-face and one-on-one.\n\nJust so you know, it wasn’t all fun and games. In the most important question of all, we also asked the players to name the biggest issue facing the league. We’ll dive into those answers in-depth in a separate piece we’ll publish a few days from now.\n\nWhy did we grant anonymity? That’s a good, and fair, question. We granted anonymity because it gave the players the freedom to respond honestly, without fear of upsetting teammates, opposing players, league officials and even fans. The anonymity served as a kind of truth serum that’s equal parts illuminating and entertaining. We learned a lot.\n\nIn some cases, players chose not to answer certain questions, which, of course, is their right. So in the spirit of transparency, we’re telling you how many of the 108 players answered each question. For example, 59 players answered when we asked them to name the worst referee.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this piece — and learn a little something, just like we did.\n\nAnd away we go!\n\n(Editor’s Note: In some cases, the combined percentages of all the answers to a question may not add up to 100 percent, because individual percentages have been rounded up or down to the nearest tenth of a percentage point.)\n\n\n\nAfter all these months of discussion in media circles about how this MVP race was destined to be one of the closest ever, this much is clear: That wouldn’t be the case if the players were the voters instead of the 100 media members the NBA selects. It’s Embiid for the win, fittingly, in dominant form.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few samplings from the Embiid supporters who were polled:\n\n“There’s not many people in the league you may fear, but I think he’s one of those few people that you have appropriate fear for every time you go out,” one player said.\n\n“Dominance,” another player said of Embiid. “He’s the hardest player to stop in the league, and his team is winning.”\n\n“I think he’s a clear-cut (No. 1), to be honest — and he plays defense,” said another player of Embiid. “When you’ve got a guy that plays both ends, like Joel Embiid, I think he’s just got to win.”\n\nAs several other players shared, their view on this MVP winner was partly formed by Embiid finishing second to Jokić in the 2021-22 campaign. Past seasons aren’t supposed to be part of the MVP calculus, of course, but it’s an undeniable part of the conversation.\n\n“To be honest, I just don’t want to see somebody win three times in a row,” another player who selected Embiid said.\n\n“He deserved it last year,” another said. “He should get it this year.”\n\n(The Athletic will delve deeper into players’ opinions about the MVP vote in an article we’ll publish later this week.)\n\n\n\nWhat a difference four years and playing on a larger stage can make. When this poll was put together in 2019, Jrue Holiday, then a member of New Orleans Pelicans, finished sixth in this category, garnering just 3.5 percent of the vote. But after a trade to Milwaukee in 2020, he played a massive part in the Bucks’ 2020-21 title run, showcasing his two-way talents on the game’s biggest stage. He doubled-down this season; with running mate Khris Middleton missing more than half the season because of injuries, Holiday’s defense helped Milwaukee compile the league’s best overall record. Holiday is finally getting the flowers he always deserved.\n\n“He’s literally a guy you avoid,” an opposing player said. “Every offense looks to get the ball away from where he is, both guarding the ball and away from the ball. His hands are unbelievable. It’s always been Jrue Holiday for me.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere’s this sobering reality of these results, too: It doesn’t take long for reputations to change. The Clippers’ Kawhi Leonard won this category by a large margin in 2019, yet received just two percent of the vote this time around. The drop was even more drastic for Rudy Gobert, the Minnesota big man and three-time Defensive Player of the Year who was third in the 2019 poll yet received zero votes in this edition. What’s more, none of the previous poll’s top five (Leonard, George, Gobert, Patrick Beverley, Embiid) even made this top 10.\n\n\n\nRemember that whole speech up above about how reputations can change quickly in this league? Well, Giannis has something to say about that. His stature has indeed changed since 2019, when he won this category by receiving 36.4 percent of the vote. But like him, his rep has gotten better.\n\nHe’s not only an all-time great — two MVPs, a Finals MVP, seven All-Star appearances and a Defensive Player of the Year award already at the age of 28 — but he’s on track to be near the tippy-top portion of that list (we had him at No. 24 in January 2022).\n\n“He looks like he has no signs of slowing down,” a player said. “He’s been dominating the NBA for so long. He’s so serious about his craft and his work ethic. He’s going to be great for at least another eight or nine years. That makes for a good, long run.”\n\nSpeaking of timelines, it’s quite remarkable that LeBron is still inspiring fellow players — in 2023 — to declare him the best building block of them all at the ripe OLD age of 38.\n\n\n\nApparently it took four titles for players (not named Dillon Brooks) to finally stop questioning Draymond Green’s greatness. He shared this unwelcome distinction with Russell Westbrook in 2019 by earning 17.0 percent of the vote, but slid down to 3.7 percent in this edition. (Westbrook received no votes.)\n\nAs for Young, it should surprise no one that even his fellow players are somewhat skeptical of him these days. He’s the Atlanta Hawks franchise centerpiece player during this time of great tumult and organizational transition, which means the spotlight will fall mostly on him. Just as it did in a much more flattering way years ago when the Hawks made their unexpected run to the East Finals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd how’s this for an oddity worth highlighting? Six players — Deandre Ayton, Tobias Harris, Jaren Jackson Jr., Damian Lillard, Austin Reaves and Nikola Vučević — received votes for both “most overrated” and “most underrated” (a category you can find next). The Lillard inclusion in this section was quite unexpected.\n\n“(The Blazers) haven’t really won that much,” the player who voted for Lillard said. “I know he’s a great player individually, but … that’s what happens when you shoot that much. And then just over his career, he (hasn’t) won that much. It’s not his fault, in particular, but I just think he’s a little overhyped.”\n\nOf all the surprises, though, it was the Donovan Mitchell vote that topped that list from this vantage point — especially with this career year that he’s having in Cleveland.\n\n“I usually rate it on how easy it is to guard somebody, and I feel like if I’m matched up against him I feel pretty comfortable,” the player said of Mitchell. “For where he’s at in the league, I shouldn’t feel that comfortable, you know?”\n\n\n\nOK, so there may be an overcorrection happening on the Jrue Holiday front here. How can he win the “best defender” award by a landslide, yet also be deemed the “most underrated” in this season in which he was an All-Star and will quite possibly be on an All-NBA team?\n\nPerhaps it’s because, while NBA players have always respected Holiday, those same players perceive that everyone else — fans, the media and even head coaches who have determined All-Star reserves each season — haven’t given Holiday his just due. After all, Holiday had made only one All-Star team in his 13 seasons before this year.\n\nBy the way, he won this category with an almost identical mark (16.3 percent of the vote) in 2019. Despite what these answers might suggest, we think his days of being overlooked and underappreciated are officially over. After all, Holiday finally received his first All-Star nod in a decade this past season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if this player still doesn’t agree that Holiday is getting his just due.\n\n“What he does on a night-in, night-out basis on both ends of the court is unmatched, and probably goes by a little bit unnoticed under the spotlight of Giannis,” the player said.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s only fair to make sure we share the positive perspective on Lillard from one of his supporters here as well since one of his skeptics spoke before.\n\n“I don’t think he gets the credit that he deserves,” the player said. “Obviously, he’s hard headed in the way that (he’s decided) that, ‘I’m going to win here (in Portland). You guys are gonna come to me. I’m not gonna go to you, and I’m gonna try to win.’ (But) I respect that about him.”\n\n\n\nMichael Jordan continues to lead the GOAT race. It’s no surprise that he continues to cast a shadow over everyone else. He’s still a legend.\n\n“M.J., for sure,” a player said. “Definitely 6-for-6 (in the Finals) is a big thing for me. But the way I look at basketball is (it’s) about the winning, and if I feel like I need (somebody) to go win me a game, I’m picking M.J. over everybody. (I’d pick) whoever is going to carry me through a series, carry me through the playoffs, and is setting the tone. I think M.J. checks all those boxes.”\n\nWhat’s more noteworthy is that the gap between His Airness and King James is closing — and is closing fast, fast, fast. When The Athletic polled NBA players four years ago, Jordan won 73.0 percent of the vote, with James a distant second, at 11.9 percent.\n\nSo, what’s changed? James has added to his incredible list of accomplishments, winning his fourth NBA title (with a third team) and passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the league’s career points leader. No one in league history, with the possible exception of Abdul-Jabbar, has played as well at 38 years old as James played this season.\n\nBut there’s something else at work: New players have entered the league over the last four years, and with their arrival, an increasing proportion of current NBA players grew up watching James when James was the league’s most dominant player.\n\nAs one player who voted for James told us: “I grew up in the 2000s.”\n\n\n\nJames Johnson is 36 years old, which is kinda ancient in pro basketball terms.\n\nBut few, if any, people in the NBA would dare mess with him.\n\nThat’s what happens when word gets out that Johnson has earned a black belt in karate and is said to own a 20-0 record in kickboxing matches. Johnson’s nickname is “Bloodsport,” which is a damn cool nickname to have.\n\n“The whole league would say the same thing,” one player said of Johnson. “That’s not smoke they want. I’ve seen it in person.”\n\nJohnson, a 6-foot-7, 240-pound Pacers forward, topped the field when we asked this question four years ago.\n\nThe runner-up then is the same person now: 6-foot-11, 265-pound Grizzlies center Steven Adams.\n\n“He loves to wrestle,” a player said of Adams. “He’s just tough. You know you’re going to be covered in bruises after wrestling him. Yeah, he’s a tough dude.”\n\n\n\nWe acknowledge this is perhaps the most subjective of all the questions we posed to players. How, exactly, should the word “best” be interpreted here? We left that up to the players. (We could have asked them to name the loudest fans, but the truth is, crowd noise is subjective, too. After all, we’ve covered hundreds of players throughout our careers, and none of them ever took a decibel meter reading during a game.)\n\nThat said, we agree that the top-two vote-getters here — the Celtics’ TD Garden and the Kings’ Golden 1 Center — are two of the loudest venues in the league.\n\n“I know they get a lot of s— for crossing the lines sometimes but in terms of a hostile environment, I would say Boston,” one player said.” If you’re a competitor and you like playing on the road, you know everybody in the building is going to be like, ‘F— you’ or ‘I hate you.’ It’s always a good environment. Every time I’ve played there it’s been like that.”\n\nOpened in 2016, the Golden 1 Center in downtown Sacramento is one of the league’s newest, most modern arenas. But its predecessor, Arco Arena (known more recently as Sleep Train Arena), used to rock with the din of cowbells back in the days when Chris Webber, Vlade Divac and Jason Williams nearly took the Kings to the NBA Finals. These days, Kings fans are bringing the noise once again, with some cowbells still sprinkled in.\n\n“Sac was loud,” one Eastern Conference player said.\n\nThese votes also can be viewed as a triumph for fans of the NBA’s small markets, with Salt Lake City and Oklahoma City joining Sacramento among the top vote-getters.\n\n\n\nThe word “worst” in this question is subjective, too. We own that.\n\nIn our conversations with players, they tended to interpret the question as how quiet or empty an arena is.\n\nSpectrum Center in Charlotte “won” this dubious honor in large part because it was filled only to 90 percent of its capacity this season, one of the lowest figures in the league. And to be fair to Hornets fans, they didn’t have much to cheer about as the team battled injuries to star point guard LaMelo Ball and finished with a 27-55 record.\n\nOf the Pistons’ Little Caesars Arena, one opposing player said, “Nobody shows up.”\n\nThe crowds inside Capital One Arena in downtown Washington received low marks, too, with one opposing player saying, “It’s dead in there.”\n\nOther players we surveyed took this question in another direction, focusing on how fans treated opposing players. Boston’s TD Garden ranked as having the best crowd in our poll, but it also finished fifth for having the worst crowd. One player said: “It’s a little bit of everything, from the heckling to, of course, the racial stuff. There’s a lot of things that they do.”\n\nThe quality of crowds is in the eye of the beholder. Madison Square Garden is said to be “the mecca” of indoor sports, but one of our respondents said, “If you don’t play for the Knicks, you don’t want to play at Madison Square Garden.”\n\nThere’s one other thing: You may have noticed that we treated the Clippers’ crowds as separate from the Lakers’ crowds even though both teams play home games at Crypto.com Arena (formerly known as Staples Center). The truth is, the arena has a different vibe when the Lakers are hosting compared to when the Clippers are hosting; so when a player answered Crypto.com Arena, we asked the players to specify whether they were talking about Clippers home games or Lakers home games.\n\n\n\n“Pop” is a repeat winner here, which is impressive considering the state of the Spurs these days. It has been nine years since he won his fifth title as a coach and six years since San Antonio got out of the first round of the playoffs, meaning today’s players are appreciating his legacy and reputation independent of the current results during this rebuilding stage.\n\n“I’ve watched him for a long time win a lot of championships,” one player said. “I’ve heard a lot of good things about him. From afar, he has a personality. I want to see what it would be like to play for a coach like that.”\n\nSaid another: “Who wouldn’t enjoy playing for Pop?”\n\nBut Kerr, one of Popovich’s many coaching disciples, clearly continues to gain more respect from players as well. While Popovich had 40.9 percent of the vote in 2019, with Boston’s Brad Stevens second at 10 percent and Kerr third at 7.8 percent, the Warriors coach, who has four titles of his own, wasn’t too far behind this time around.\n\n“(You see) all the kind of viral clips of him talking to his players and team, and I think it’d be interesting to see up close how he operates,” one player said of Kerr.\n\n\n\nTom Thibodeau has won the NBA Coach of the Year award twice, in 2010-11 leading the Bulls and in 2020-21 leading the Knicks. He’s guided New York to another overachieving performance this season, earning the fifth seed in the East.\n\nOne of the reasons for his teams’ success is that he holds his players accountable for their efforts and attention to detail, and that, coupled with his reputation for playing his guys heavy minutes, explains why he led this category by a wide margin.\n\n“Just the grind,” one player said of Thibodeau. “He plays his guys 44 minutes (a game) all year. I’ve heard from guys like if he likes you — if you’re his guy — he’ll treat you great. He’ll play you a lot, talk to you, so you’ll f— with him in that sense. But if you’re on the outside, it’s like you’re not getting back in.”\n\nThe thing is, none of his Knicks players ranked among the league’s top 16 in minutes per game this season. Forward Julius Randle averaged 35.6 minutes per game, the 17th highest average in the league. Point guard Jalen Brunson played 35.0 minutes per game, the 23rd highest average. No other New York player ranked in the top 35.\n\n\n\nA Western Conference team has won the NBA title in 15 of the 23 postseasons completed since 2000.\n\nIn the players’ eyes, though, the league’s balance of power appears to be shifting eastward, with a whopping 73 of the 90 players naming either the Bucks or Celtics as this season’s most likely champs.\n\nIt’s the players’ confidence in the Bucks that stands out here. Antetokounmpo, Holiday and the Bucks earned players’ respect after they won the 2020-21 title and finished this season with a league-best 58-24 record. Keep in mind that The Athletic surveyed the players before the end of the regular season — and, therefore, before Antetokounmpo suffered a lower back contusion during Game 1 of the Bucks-Heat series (a game that the Heat won, 130-117).\n\n“Just veterans,” one player said, referring to the Bucks. “They’ve been there before. They know what they’re doing. They have guys at every position and go deep.”\n\nThe defending Eastern Conference champion Celtics earned their flowers, too. “I think they match up really well with other teams,” a rival player said. “They’re well-coached. They’re athletic, and when you play against them you’ve got to be really locked in.”\n\n\n\nAs anyone can see with a quick visit to the National Basketball Referees Association website, Brothers’ résumé speaks for itself. You don’t referee in this league for 29 seasons (including 174 playoff games before this postseason, 15 of them in the Finals) if you’re not pretty damn good at your craft. That’s also where you can learn that his favorite band is “Earth, Wind and Fire” and his favorite food is fried croakers, but we digress.\n\nTo hear the players tell it, it’s Brothers’ willingness to show a little personality, and humanity, that makes him approachable and helps ease the inevitable tensions that arise in every game.\n\n“He always talks s— to us,” one player said. “He interacts with us instead of taking everything personally. He’d be like, `Sit your ass down, you know you fouled him.’”\n\n“Tony’s pretty funny,” another player said.\n\nNot everyone feels this way, of course. Back on Nov. 4, then-Mavericks guard Spencer Dinwiddie voiced his displeasure with an R-rated back-and-forth that he had with Brothers during a game against Toronto. According to longtime NBA reporter Marc Stein, Brothers was forced to miss a game assignment because of the situation but was not docked any pay. Still, it seems the prevailing sentiment is that Brothers does a very good job.\n\nZarba won the poll in 2019, with Brothers finishing third. But how’s this for proof that players have a wide variety of opinions on the refs: Brothers was also voted the worst ref back then. He’ll be happy to hear, as you see below, that he no longer holds that unwelcome title.\n\n\n\nAll these years of Paul publicly complaining about Foster have surely impacted the way the veteran official is perceived, and it’s no secret that his no-nonsense style has drawn the ire of many around the Association — well beyond Paul.\n\nYet as the NBA is always quick to counter, there’s a reason Foster continues to earn prime assignments. He is consistently one of their highest-rated refs and has one of the league’s most distinguished résumés: 29 seasons and 226 playoff games in all before this postseason (23 Finals, including Game 3 of Warriors-Celtics in 2022).\n\nWhat’s more, it’s quite clear that players will always be very divided in their views of the officials. As proof, consider this quote about Brothers that is the exact opposite of the opinion that was shared above.\n\n“He’s the worst ref to ever do it in the NBA,” one player said. “He takes everything personal. He’s awful.”\n\n\n\nWhen The Athletic asks coaches throughout the league how they would’ve voted for Defensive Player of the Year and the All-Defensive teams, few players get as much love as Draymond Green does.\n\nOne of the reasons coaches value Green’s defense is that he’s a superb communicator on the floor, directing his teammates amid flurries of pick-and-roll forays.\n\nDefense isn’t the only thing Green talks about on the court.\n\nGreen is now 2-for-2 in this category for our poll, winning in 2019 and again this year.\n\n“For sure, Draymond,” a rival player said. “If you’ve never seen it before, it’s unbelievable. Unfiltered broadcast of him talking? No, I don’t think you’d want that. I think it’s too much.”\n\nAnother player said: “I actually don’t mind his trash talk. I think it gets himself going. Sometimes he’s doing it to get under guys’ skin, but it’s getting himself going. He’s playing well when he’s running his mouth, so I actually don’t mind it.”\n\nWhile Green repeated as the winner here, Patrick Beverley repeated as the runner-up.\n\nOne group to watch for next season’s survey will be the Memphis Grizzlies, and especially wing Dillon Brooks, this poll’s third-place vote-getter. “They’re frontrunners,” one player said of the Grizzlies. “They’re just extra. They talk when they’re winning. They don’t say s— when they’re losing. Their whole thing over there is just annoying.”\n\n\n\nWe’ll take a deep dive into the players’ opinions in an article this week.\n\n(Illustration: John Bradford / The Athletic; Photos: Elsa, Patrick McDermott, Mitchell Leff / Getty Images)",

Despite competing in a stacked field containing nine of the world’s top 10 players, the tournament director believes that the Brit is a contender for the title. The Porsche Tennis Grand Prix boss also claimed that Raducanu could be a future world No 1 ahead of her tough opener against Jelena Ostapenko.\n\nRaducanu is one of the wildcard entrants at this week’s Porsche Tennis Grand Prix - a tournament wildly popular with the world’s top players. The stacked draw often results in first-round matches that you wouldn’t be surprised to see make up a Grand Slam semi-final line-up.\n\nThe world No 68 has been handed a horror draw thanks to the high-calibre field, facing fellow Grand Slam champion Ostapenko with the winner meeting third seed Ons Jabeur. Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina also lurks in Raducanu’s quarter, but this hasn’t stopped the tournament boss from touting the 20-year-old as a title contender.\n\n“It’s wonderful that Coco [Gauff] and Emma are coming,” Markus Gunthardt said of the young stars. “They are two very promising players and unquestionably an enrichment for our tournament.”",

                    "snippet": "After three local champions were crowned in Georgetown, here are The Dallas Morning News’ final girls soccer rankings for the 2022-23 season.\n\nClass 6A\n\nRk. Team, Record\n\n1. Flower Mound Marcus, 26-1-1\n\nPreseason ranking: 2\n\nNews Roundups Catch up on the day's news you need to know. Email Address By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy SUBMIT\n\nUnder interim head coach Erin Hebert, Marcus rose from arguably the state’s most competitive district and fought through a grueling playoff road to win its first state title since 2005. Freshman Madi Patterson and senior forward Bella Campos led their team through a playoff slate that included meetings with area-ranked Allen, Byron Nelson and undefeated reigning 6A state champion Southlake Carroll before beating Fort Bend Ridge Point 2-0 in the state final.\n\n2. Wylie East, 28-1\n\nPreseason ranking: Unranked\n\nIn Wylie East’s first season in Class 6A, it didn’t allow a single goal until its 17th game of the year and entered the state tournament a perfect 28-0. Senior goalkeeper Breanna Wooten and Wake Forest commit Amaya Dawkins led East to its first state tournament since it won state in 2015 at the 5A level. East allowed five goals all year heading into the state tournament before falling 4-3 to Ridge Point in double overtime.\n\n3. Southlake Carroll, 29-1\n\nPreseason ranking: 1\n\nThe reigning state champions were poised to repeat all season long, as they dominated every opponent that crossed their path, averaging 6.3 goals per game. A rematch of last year’s Class 6A Region I final saw Carroll fall on an own goal while missing two of its top goal scorers — Zoe Matthew and UNC commit Kennedy Fuller, who broke program records with 136 points and 55 goals.\n\n4. Trophy Club Byron Nelson, 18-5-3\n\nPreseason ranking: Unranked\n\nByron Nelson played in Carroll’s shadow in District 4-6A for much of the season, but finished second in district with its only losses coming to area-ranked opponents. Byron Nelson beat district opponent Keller in the third round to reach the regional semifinals where it took eventual state champions Marcus to double overtime before falling 1-0 despite losing 4-0 to them in the first game of the season.\n\n5. McKinney Boyd, 19-6-3\n\nPreseason ranking: Unranked\n\nDespite finishing third in its district, McKinney Boyd advanced to the regional semifinals where it led Carroll before eventually falling 3-1 on its home turf. Boyd pulled off three consecutive upsets against area-ranked teams in the postseason, taking down Hebron, Highland Park and district rival Prosper for a second time this season to advance to the regional tournament.\n\n6. Mansfield, 20-2-1\n\nPreseason ranking: Unranked\n\nMansfield lost just one game entering the postseason to San Angelo Central, but flew under the radar competing in a less competitive district and region in 6A Region II. However, it upset one of the favorites to emerge from the region, Rockwall-Heath, in the second round, outscoring its first three playoff opponents 10-0 before ultimately falling to Cypress Bridgeland in the regional semifinals.\n\n7. Allen, 22-2-2\n\nPreseason ranking: 4\n\nAllen went undefeated in District 5-6A, as goalkeeper Robbi Curry was among the area leaders in shut outs at 12 in the regular season. Vanderbilt commit Melania Fullerton led Allen again this season as it tore through the first two rounds of the postseason before narrowly falling to Marcus in the third round.\n\n8. Prosper, 17-3-5\n\nPreseason ranking: 5\n\nBeing in District 5-6A, Prosper was set up for a grueling first-round matchup against Flower Mound for the second straight year. Unlike last season, it came away with the narrow 1-0 victory, setting it up for a clearer path to the regional tournament. However, Prosper tripped up on McKinney Boyd for the second time this season in the third round, bringing an earlier end to its postseason.\n\n9. Rockwall, 16-5-2\n\nPreseason ranking: 3\n\nLast year’s state finalists faced some adversity early in the 2023 season, losing three games in tournament play. But a mid-season win streak during which Rockwall won 11 straight earned it a spot back in the postseason. However, this year it got a taste of its own medicine, falling to this season’s surprise program Wylie East in the third round.\n\n10. Keller, 20-4-1\n\nPreseason ranking: 6\n\nKeller won its first 10 games before it had to face Southlake Carroll in the regular season and received the wake-up call of a 5-0 loss. Its own district became its biggest challenge, as its only losses came to two teams — Carroll twice in the regular season and Byron Nelson once in the regular season and once to knock it out of the playoffs in the regional quarterfinals. Goalkeeper Sydney Fuller was a standout, as she led an effort in goal that posted 18 shutouts.\n\nClass 5A/others\n\nRk. Team, Record\n\n1. Grapevine, 26-3-2\n\nPreseason ranking: 1\n\nAfter falling in a state semifinal or final game in four of the last eight seasons to a Frisco ISD team, Grapevine finally overcame its heartbreaking past to win its first state title on its sixth state tournament appearance and third consecutive. Baylor signee Theresa McCullough scored the game-winner and led her team in a 16-game win streak to close out the season. Grapevine’s three losses came in non-district tournament play in December.\n\n2. Celina, 29-0\n\nPreseason ranking: 4\n\nCelina became just the third girls soccer team in UIL history to win a state title without any ties or losses on its record. It defended its 2022 4A state title by beating Stephenville 8-1 in the championship game where senior forward Lexi Tuite scored a UIL record five goals — four of which came in the first half. Celina scored eight or more goals on 11 occasions this season.\n\n3. Frisco, 23-3-2\n\nPreseason ranking: 2\n\nFrisco had reached the state tournament just once before in 2004 but found its way back in 2023. It came up short in the final against Grapevine but walked away from Georgetown with the program’s 300th win, as senior Lexi Lee carried her team to its first state tournament game win in the semifinal in program history.\n\n4. Frisco Reedy, 21-5-3\n\nPreseason ranking: Unranked\n\nDespite beating Frisco twice in the regular season, Reedy fell to its district rival in their third meeting in a shootout in the regional final. Nevertheless, Reedy finished second in a highly competitive District 9-5A before advancing five rounds deep for the first time.\n\n5. Anna, 17-10-1\n\nPreseason ranking: Unranked\n\nMost of Anna’s losses came to opponents from higher classifications in non-district play, but once district began, it claimed the No. 2 spot in 11-4A behind eventual state champion Celina, whom it fell to three times, including in the Class 4A Region II final.\n\n6. McKinney North, 20-5-2\n\nPreseason ranking: Unranked\n\nMcKinney North won 15 of its final 16 games heading into the regional semifinals against Frisco, where it fell 3-1. North claimed the District 13-5A crown — its first outright district championship since 2014 — after going undefeated in district play.\n\n7. Forney, 22-7-2\n\nPreseason ranking: 9\n\nForney also turned its season around once district play began, winning 14 of its last 15 games before facing Frisco Reedy in the fourth round. Kaitlyn Johnson led her team with 40 goals through the end of the regular season — good for sixth in the Dallas area.\n\n8. Frisco Wakeland, 17-8-2\n\nPreseason ranking: 3\n\nThe defending champions did not complete the attempt to go back-to-back, but advanced to the third round for the sixth consecutive season. Wakeland ultimately fell to district rival Reedy, missing the state tournament for the first time since 2019.\n\n9. Midlothian, 21-2-3\n\nPreseason ranking: 8\n\nMidlothian was the area’s top 5A team heading into the postseason and a favorite to advance out of Class 5A Region II. However, it fell short in the third round when eventual state champion Grapevine won 3-2 in double overtime in what arguably decided the state champion.\n\n10. Lovejoy, 16-4-1\n\nPreseason ranking: 6\n\nLovejoy also lost in the third round after finishing second in its district with its only district losses coming against McKinney North. Despite posting shut outs in 13 of its 16 wins, Lovejoy was ultimately shut out 2-0 in the regional quarterfinals by Forney.\n\nOn Twitter: @Lassimak\n\nFind more high school sports coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.\n\nSign up for our FREE HS newsletter",
